c (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut
c Light corn syrup
pk (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate pieces
c Vegetable shortening
Whole natural almonds (1-oz)

Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling rack
on paper; set aside.
Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1 minute
or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm syrup into
coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is thoroughly coated.
This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough syrup.
Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between both
palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into balls.) Place 2
inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so
there are no loose ends of coconut sticking up.
Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2 quart
microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can
be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.
Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate
over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess
chocolate drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft,
lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place
in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container.
Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 26.

1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon paprika
Chicken Marinade:
1 cup water
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire
Cajun Spice Blend:
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup fat free shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup fat free shredded cheddar cheese

Applebee's Low-Fat

1 large tomato, diced
1 hardboiled egg white, diced
1. Make dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well by hand.
Store in a covered container in the refrigerator until salad is ready.
2. Combine water, lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl,
and stir. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, cover bowl and keep in
refrigerator for several hours. Overnight is even better.
3. When chicken is marinated, preheat a frying pan or skillet (an iron
skillet, if you’ve got it) over medium/high heat. Also, preheat your
barbecue grill to medium/high heat.
4. Combine the spices for the Cajun spice blend in a small bowl. Sprinkle a
teaspoon of the spice blend over one side of each of the chicken breasts.
Cover the entire surface of the chicken with spice.
5. Melt the butter in the hot pan, then sear the chicken breasts for 2-3
minutes on the side with the spices. While first side cooks, sprinkle
another teaspoon of spice over the top of each chicken breast, coating
that side as you did the other. Flip the chicken over, and sear for
another 2-3 minutes. The surface of the chicken will be coated with a
charred, black layer of flavor. This is exactly what you are shooting for.
6. Finish the chicken off on your barbecue grill. Grill each breast on
both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until they are done.
7. While chicken is cooking prepare the salads by splitting the lettuce into
two large bowls. Toss in the red cabbage and carrots. Mix the cheeses
together, then top the salad with the cheeses and hardboiled egg.
Sprinkle the diced tomato on each salad.
8. Slice the chicken breast, across each breast in 1/2-inch-thick slices.
Spread the chicken over the top of the salad and serve immediately with
dressing on the side.
Serves 2 as an entree.

Salt
Mayonnaise
Dill pickle slices
Coarsely chopped lettuce
Tomato slices

Preheat a clean barbecue grill on high. Toast both halves of the
bun, face down, in a skillet over medium heat. Set aside. Cut each
of the 2 onion rings into quarters. Mix the catsup and relish
together. This is your "secret sauce." Form the ground beef into a
thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Grill the meat for 2 or 3
minutes per side. Salt slightly. Build the burger in the following
stacking order from the bottom up: bottom bun, half of the
mayonnaise, pickles, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, beef patty,
remainder of mayonnaise, special sauce (catsup and relish), top bun.
Cheese Nips
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
(plus 1/2 cup divided & reserved for kneading and rolling)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Cheese Topping powder
(or 2 packages dry cheese powder from 2 boxes Kraft macaroni & cheese)
3 tablespoons shortening
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon salt (for tops, optional)
1. Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese
powder in a large bowl.
2. Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion
until dough is broken down into rice-size pieces. Mixture will still
be very dry.

3. Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and
sticky.
4. Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and
work it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out
onto a floured board, being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour
for later. Knead the dough well for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is
incorporated. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least
one hour.
5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a light coating of cooking spray
on a baking sheet.
6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserve
flour to dust a rolling surface. Roll about one-third of the dough
to just under 1/16th of inch thick. Trim the edges square (a pizza
cutter or wheel works great for this), then transfer the dough to a
lightly greased baking sheet. Use the rolling pin to transfer the
dough. Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin, and roll
the dough around the rolling pin. Reverse the process onto the baking
sheet to transfer the dough.
7. Use a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch
square pieces. Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to
poke a hole in the center of each piece.
8. Sprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers
(crackers will already be quite salty) and bake for 8-10 minutes,
mix the crackers around (so those on the edge don’t burn) and bake
for another 3-5 minutes, or until some are just barely turning a
light brown. Repeat the rolling and baking process with the remaining
dough.
Makes approximately 300 crackers.

cups graham cracker crumbs
tablespoons butter, melted
cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
teaspoon vanilla
cup canned pumpkin
eggs
teaspoon cinnamon
teaspoon nutmeg
teaspoon allspice
whipped cream

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Make the crust by combining the graham cracker crumbs with the melted
butter and 1 tablespoon sugar in a medium bowl. Stir well enough to
coat all of the crumbs with the butter, but not so much as to turn the
mixture into paste. Keep it crumbly.

3. Press the crumbs onto the bottom and about two-thirds of the way up
the sides of a springform pan. You don't want the crust to form all
of the way up the back of each slice of cheesecake. Bake the crust
for 5 minutes, then set it aside until you are ready to fill it.
4. In a large mixing bowl combine the cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and
vanilla. Mix with an electric mixer until smooth.
5. Add the pumpkin, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice and continue
to beat until smooth and creamy.
6. Pour the filling into the pan. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes. The top will
turn a bit darker at this point. Remove from the oven and allow the
cheesecake to cool.
7. When the cheesecake has come to room temperature, put it into the
refrigerator. When the cheesecake has chilled, remove the pan sides
and cut the cake into 8 equal pieces. Use dental floss to make a
clean cut.
Serve with a generous portion of whipped cream on top.
Serves 8.

Corn Cake

Chi Chi's Sweet

1/2 cup (1 stick butter), softened
1/3 cup masa harina (mexican corn flour, usually in Latin American
groceries or next to flour. Possibly in Mexican food section)
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups frozen corn, thawed
1/4 cup cornmeal
1/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons heavy cream

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoons baking powder
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Blend butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.
Add the masa harina and water to the butter and beat until well combined.
Put defrosted corn into a blender or food processor and with short
pulses, coarsely chop the corn on low speed. You want to leave several
whole pieces of corn.
Stir the chopped corn into the butter and masa harina mixture.
Add cornmeal to mixture and combine.
In another medium bowl, mix together the sugar, cream, salt, and
baking powder. When the ingredients are well blended, pour the mixture
into the other bowl and stir everything together BY HAND.
Pour corn batter into an ungreased 8"x8" baking pan.
Cover the pan with aluminum foil. Place this pan into a 13"x9" pan
filled 1/3 of the way up with hot water. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until
the corn cake is cooked through. When the corn cake is done, remove
the small pan from the larger pan and let sit for at least 10 minutes.
To serve, scoop out each portion with an ice cream scoop or
rounded spoon.

Skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved
Plain hamburger buns
Melted butter
Dill pickle slices

Heat the peanut oil in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about 400F. In
a small bowl, beat the egg and stir in the milk. In a separate bowl,
combine the flour, sugar, pepper, and salt. dip each piece of chicken in
milk until it is fully moistened. Roll the moistened chicken in the flour
mixture until completely coated. Drop all four chicken pieces into the hot
oil and close the pressure cooker. When steam starts shooting through the
pressure release, set the timer for 3-1/2 minutes. IMPORTANT!!!!
DO NOT CLOSE STEAM RELEASE. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS! While the chicken is
cooking, spread a coating of melted butter on the face of each bun. When
the chicken is done, remove it from the oil and drain or blot on paper
towels. Place two pickles on each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then
the top bun. To make a deluxe chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato
slices and a leaf of lettuce. Mayonnaise also goes well on this
sandwich--it is a side order at the restaurant.

cup granulated sugar
cup brown sugar
cup (1 stick) butter
cup corn syrup
cup water
teaspoon salt
teaspoon vanilla
bags plain or natural-flavored microwave popcorn
cup roasted almonds

1. Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, water and salt in a large saucepan
over medium heat. You're going to bring the candy to 265-275 degrees,
or what is known as the hard ball stage. For this it's best to use a
candy thermometer. If you don't have one, don't worry. Drip the candy
into a small glass of cold water. If the candy forms a very hard, yet

slightly pliable ball, bingo, you're there. Watch your mixture closely
so that it doesn't boil over.
2. While candy cooks, pop both bags of popcorn and spread about 2 quarts
or 1 1/3 bags of popcorn on one large or two small cookie sheets.
Put the popcorn in your oven set on its lowest temperature. This will
keep the popcorn hot so that the candy will coat better.
3. When your candy has reached the hard ball stage, add the vanilla.
4. Pull the popcorn from the oven and, working quickly, pour the candy
over the popcorn in thin streams. Mix the popcorn so that each kernel
is coated with candy, put the popcorn back into the oven for five more
minutes, then stir once again. This will help to coat each kernel.
You can repeat this step once more if necessary to get all of the
popcorn coated. Pour popcorn onto a large sheet of wax paper to cool.
Spread the popcorn out, but be careful...it's hot.
5. When popcorn is cool, break it up and immediately put it into a
tightly sealed container, such as Tupperware. This will ensure that
it stays fresh. This stuff gets stale very quickly in moist climates
if left out.
Makes about 4 quarts.

Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce

all-purpose flour
paprika

chicken wing pieces

ON THE SIDE: bleu cheese dressing & celery sticks
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375. You want just enough oil to cover the
wings entirely -- an inch or so deep at least.
Combine the butter, hot sauce, ground pepper, and garlic powder in a
small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the butter is melted and
the ingredients are well-blended.
Combine the flour, paprika, cayenne powder, and salt in a small bowl.
If the wings are frozen, be sure to defrost and dry them. Put the wings
in a large bowl and sprinkle the flour mixture over them, coating each
wing evenly. Put the wings in the refrigerator 60-90 minutes.
This will help the breading to stick to the wings when fried.
Put all the wings in the hot oil and fry 10 to 15 minutes or until
some parts of the wings begin to turn dark brown. Remove from the oil
to a paper towel to drain. Don't let them sit too long, because you
want to serve them hot. Quickly put the wings in a large bowl. Add the hot
sauce and stir, coating all of the wings evenly.
Serve with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks on the side.

FILLING:
1 c Heavy whipping cream
6 oz Finely chopped white chocolate
GLAZE:

3 oz Finely chopped bittersweet chocolate
3 tb Boiling water

ICING:

1/2 c

1 tb Egg white, at room temperature
1 pn cream of tartar
Plus 2 to 3 tbsp confectioner's sugar

Make the cupcakes:
1. Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 325F. Lightly
butter twenty-four 1-3/4" x 3/4" (1-oz) muffin of biscuit cups.
2. Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda,
and salt. Mix in the sugar. Make a well in the center. Whisk in the
water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. (The batter
will be very thin.)
3. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups. Bake until a cake tester
inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean,
about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack
for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and finish cooling
on the rack.
Make the filling:
4. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream
to a boil. Add the white chocolate and remove from heat. let the
mixture stand briefly; stir until smooth. Transfer to a metal bowl
and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, stirring occasionally. (To
speed the process, set the metal bowl over a larger bowl of ice
water; stir the chocolate mixture until cool.) With an electric
mixer, beat the white chocolate mixture just until fluffy, about 1
minute.
5. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain
tip. Insert the pastry tip 1/4-inch into the bottom of each cupcake
and squeeze a little filling into each one.
Make the glaze:
6. Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Whisk in the boiling water and
blend until smooth. One at a time, dip the top of each cupcake into
the warm glaze. Turn the glazed cupcakes right side up and set them
on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Refrigerate the cupcakes for
5 minutes to set the glaze.
Make the icing:
7. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Stir in the
cream of tartar. Gradually mix in enough of the confectioner's sugar

to make a fairly stiff and smooth icing. Fill a small paper cone with
the icing and cut a 1/16-inch opening at the tip. Remove the cupcakes
from the refrigerator. Pipe a design (a squiggle, spiral, etc.) on
the top of each cupcake. Let the design harden and then cover and
refrigerate the cupcakes. Serve at room temperature.
The cupcakes can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or
frozen up to 2 weeks.
Makes 22 to 24 miniature cupcakes.

about 2 minutes until thoroughly blended. Pour batter into molds, filling
each about 3/4 inch deep. Bake about 30 minutes, or until the cake is
golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean from the center.
For the filling, cream the butter and shortening. Slowly add the sugars
while beating. Add the evaporated milk, vanilla and lemon extracts. Mix on
medium speed until completely smooth and fluffy. When the cakes are done
and cooled, use a toothpick to make three small holes in the bottom of

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, 1/2
cup of the water, and the salt. Heat to boiling, then cook using a candy
thermometer to monitor the temperature.
Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks. Don't use a
plastice bowl for this.
When the sugar mixture reaches 270~F, or the soft crack stage. Remove from
the heat and pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg whites, blending
completely with an electric mixer set on low.
Continue to mix about 20 minutes or until the nougat begins to harden and
thickens to the consistency of dough. Mix in the almonds.
Press the nougat into a greased 9 x 9 inch pan and chill until firm about
30 minutes.
Melt the caramels with the remaining 2 tb. water in a small saucepan over
medium heat.
Pour the caramel over the nougat and return the pan to the refrigerator.
When the caramel and nougat are firm (about 30 min), slice down the middle
of the pan with a sharp knife and then slice across into 7 segments to make
a total of 14 bars.
Melt the milk chocolate chips in a microwave for 2 minutes on half power,
stirring halfway through the cooking time. Melt completely, but be careful
not to overheat.
Resting the bar on a fork (and use fingers if needed) dip each bar into the
chocolate to coat completely and tap the fork against the side of the bowl
to knock off the excess chocolate. Place on waxed paper and let cool at
room temperature until the chocolate is firm; 1-2 hours.

and press flat, 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Bottom of
a glass works nice for this. Bake 4 to 6 minutes or until cookies are
crunchy. I should think you could refrigerate the dough in cylinder
shaped rolls for a couple of hours and slice 1/8 inch thick, as well.
Let cookies cool on sheets.
Combine filling ingredients and mix well. Form into balls about 1/2 to
3/4 inch in diameter, again using your hands. Sandwich one

Outback Steakhouse Aussie Fries
1 - 2 lb. bag of Frozen French Fries
1 Cup shredded Colby Jack cheese
6 pieces of Bacon, cooked
24 Fl. Oz. Peanut Oil (can be reused later; store
in refrigerator)
Divide the fries into half, and use the other half later.
Heat oil to 350 degrees. If you do not have a thermostat, make sure
the oil is hot enough, so that when you set a french fry in there it
will cook immediately. If the french fry sinks to the bottom, and
barely bubbles, it is not hot enough. Fry the potatoes in small
batches, they are done when they are golden brown, and float to the
top of the skillet. ( I like to use a Dutch Oven). Be sure to drain
the potatoes on paper towels. You can keep them warm in the oven
while the other fries are done.
When all french fries are done cooking, and drained place them onto
a platter. Salt the french fries if you like, and sprinkle on cheese
and cooked bacon. Pop these back into a warm oven until the cheese
begins to melt.

cocoa

water
red food coloring
blue food coloring

Cornmeal for dusting
1. If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough
in the exact order listed into the pan of your machine. Set it on
"knead" and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the
food coloring with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as
it combines. After the dough is created let it rest to rise for an
hour or so. Then remove it from the pan and go to step #3.
2. If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar,
coffee and salt in large bowl. Make a depression or "well" in the
middle of the dry mixture. Pour the warm water into this "well,"
then add the butter, honey and yeast. Combine the food coloring
drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the "well." Slowly mix
the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into
the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand,
kneading the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is

very smooth and has a consistent color. Set the dough into a covered
bowl in a warm place for an hour, to allow it to rise.
3. When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and
divide it into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those
halves in half, and then once more). Form the portions into tubular
shaped loaves about 8 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the
entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and place them on a cookie
sheet, or two. Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic wrap and let
the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Uncover the dough and bake it for
20-24 minutes in the hot oven. Loaves should begin to darken slightly
on top when done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter
on the side. If you want whipped butter, like you get at the
restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high speed to whip
some butter until it's fluffy.
Makes 8 small loaves.
Outback Steakhouse Sydney's Sinful Sundae
1 cup shredded coconut
4 large scoops vanilla ice cream
1/2 cup Hershey chocolate syrup
whipped cream (in a can)
4 large, ripe strawberries
1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
2. Spread the coconut over the bottom of the inside of a large oven pan.
Shake the pan a little to spread the coconut evenly.
3. Bake the coconut for 25-30 minutes or until the coconut is a light,
golden brown. You may have to stir or shake the coconut in the
last 10 minutes to help it brown evenly.
4. When the coconut has cooled, pour it onto a plate, or into a
large bowl. Roll each scoop of ice cream in the coconut until it is
well coated. Press down on the ice cream to help the coconut stick.
Put the ice cream into four separate bowls.
5. Heat up the chocolate syrup for 10-15 seconds in the microwave.
Pour about two tablespoons over each scoop of ice cream.
Try to completely cover the ice cream with chocolate.
6. Spray some whipped cream on the top of each scoop of ice cream.
7. Cut the stems from the strawberries and place one on each serving;
upside down on the whipped cream. Serve with a spoon.
Serves four.

With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.
When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the bowl
with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9-inch pan. Put in
the refrigerator. Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.
When the caramel is soft, mix in the peanuts. Pour the mixture over the
refrigerated nougat in the pan. Let this cool in the refrigerator.
When the refrigerated mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low heat
in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2 minutes.
Stir halfway through cooking time. When the mixture in the pan has
hardened, cut it into 2x1-inch sections. Set each chunk onto a fork
and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the fork against the side of the
bowl or pan to knock off any excess chocolate. Then place the chunks on
waxed paper to cool at room temperature (less than 70 degrees F). This
could take several hours, but the bars will set best this way. You can
speed up the process by placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30
minutes.
Makes about 2 dozen bars.

lb All-purpose or bread flour
t Salt
1/2 T Dry yeast
t Sugar
cup Warm milk
oz Butter, melted

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and leave in a warm place. Dissolve

the yeast and sugar in warm (105 F) milk (M-Waved). Let froth,
then mix in the butter. Stir all the liquid into the warm flour and beat
well until smooth and elastic. Cover and proof in a warm place for 50
minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and
knead, working a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier
to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage shape and (using
the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10 portions, each about 1 1/2
~ 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round with straight sides. Put
onto a greased baking sheet. Cover (use greased plastic wrap) and put
in a warm place to proof for 30-40 minutes or until springy to the touch.
Leave room for expansion and be careful not to over-proof, as the muffins
will get flabby and lose their shape. Warm and grease the bakestone
lightly. Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very
moderate heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook
the other side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches. To
serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly apart,
and insert slivers of butter.

dip it into the chocolate. Tap the fork on the side of the pan or bowl
to knock off any excess chocoloate. Then place each one on a sheet
of waxed paper and let them cool at room temperature (65-70F).
This could take several hours, but the bars will set best this way.
If you want to speed up the process, put the candy in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Makes 40 bars.

101st Airborne Beer Cheese Soup
1 large can chicken broth
1 medium jar cheese whiz
1 can stale beer
cayenne pepper to taste
Heat broth to boiling, reduce heat, add cheese whiz, stir till melted, add
beer and reheat, but do not boil. Top with bacon bits and green onions

101st Airborne Beer Cheese Soup

3 Musketeers Bars
3 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 egg whites
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 bags milk chocolate chips (12−ounce bags)
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar,
corn syrup, water, and salt. Heat, stirring, to boiling, then continue
to cook using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.
Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks. Don't use a
plastic bowl for this. When the sugar solution comes to 270 degrees F,
or the soft−crack stage, remove from the heat and pour the mixture in
thin streams into the egg whites, blending completely with a mixer set
on low speed. Continue to mix until the candy begins to harden to the
consistency of dough. This may take as long as 20 minutes. At this point
add the semisweet chocolate chips. Remember that the candy must
already be at the consistency of dough when you add the chocolate;
the nougat will thicken no more after the chocolate is added.
When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and the nougat has thickened,
Press it into a greased 9x9−inch pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 30
minutes. With a sharp knife, cut the candy in half down the middle of
the pan. Then cut across into 7 segments to create a total of 14 bars.
Melt the milk chocolate chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half
power, stirring halfway through the heating time. Melt completely, but
be careful not to overheat. Resting a bar on a fork dip each bar into
the chocolate to coat completely and place on wax paper.
Cool until firm at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours. Makes 14 candy bars.

1/2 Tablespoon Kraft shredded mild cheddar cheese (optional)
A&W Coney Island Chili Dog Sauce
1 pound ground chuck
1 six ounce can Hunts tomato paste
1 Cup water
1 Tablespoon sugar
1 Tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 Tablespoon dried, minced onion
2 teaspoons chili powder

microwaving what you need later.
Cooking your A&W Chili Dog
1. Bring a 2 qt. saucepan of water to a rolling boil.
2. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and add the desired number of
frankfurters to the water. Cover and let sit about 10 minutes.
3. After the franks are done, microwave the chili dog sauce until steaming.
(Only microwave what you need, save the rest) Then microwave each hot dog
roll 10 seconds....just enough to warm.

Almond Joy Bars
Ingredients (26 servings)
4 c (8 1/2−oz) shredded coconut
1/4 c Light corn syrup
1 pk (11 1/2−oz) milk chocolate pieces
1/4 c Vegetable shortening
26 Whole natural almonds (1−oz)
Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling rack
on paper; set aside.
Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
Place corn syrup in a 1−cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1 minute
or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm syrup into
coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is thoroughly coated.
This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough syrup.
Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between both
palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into balls.) Place 2
inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so
there are no loose ends of coconut sticking up.
Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4−cup glass measure or 1 1/2 quart
microwave−safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can
be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.
Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate
over each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess
chocolate drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft,
lightly press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place
in refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container.
Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 26.

Andouille Sausage
1−1/2 Yards large sausage casing, approximately (about 2−3 inches wide)
4 Pound Lean fresh pork
2 Pound Pork fat
3 1/3 Tablespoon Finely minced garlic
2 Tablespoon Salt
1/2 Teaspoon Freshly ground black pepper
1/8 Teaspoon Cayenne
1/8 Teaspoon Chili powder
1/8 Teaspoon Mace
1/8 Teaspoon Allspice
1/2 Teaspoon Dried thyme
1 Tablespoon Paprika
1/4 Teaspoon Ground bay leaf
1/4 Teaspoon Sage
5 Teaspoon Colgin's liquid hickory smoke
Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the
salt in which it is packed. Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow
end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of
the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the inside
of the casing to remove any salt.
(Roll up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse
salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of
the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later use.)
Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once through
the coarse blade of the meat grinder. Combine the pork with the remaining
ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut the
casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each piece
of casing about 2 inches from one end. Fit the open end over the tip of the
sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push the
rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot.
(The casing will look like accordian folds on the stuffer.)
Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that
come with the machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over
the opeoning by hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if
it is electric and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual
machine, push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage casing

will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the
funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps
carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out
of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of
string or make a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is
used up.
To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with
no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the
edges.

Bob's Big Boy
1 pound ground chuck
8 jumbo sesame seed buns
1 cup shredded lettuce
4 slices real American cheese
salt
Sauce:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 Tablespoons sweet relish
2 Tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons water
In a small container, combine the mayo, relish, ketchup, and water.
Set aside. This is your Big Boy sauce.
Carefully form the beef into eight equal sized, round patties about
4" in diameter. Do this on waxed paper. Discard the top half of four
of the eight buns. Toast the the buns until golden. The extra bottom,
or "heal" is your middle bun, or "club".
After the buns are toasted, grill your freshly formed beef patties.
Salt liberally. Cook for about two minutes, then turn and add another
dash of salt. Cook for about another two minutes.
While the beef is cooking, dress your Big Boy buns as follows:
Put half the sauce on the toasted bottom, and the other half on the
middle, adding 1/8 cup of lettuce to each. The slice of cheese goes
on top of the lettuce on the true bottom bun.
When the beef is done, drain excess fat by tilting the patty to the
side while holding it to the spatula with your free hand. Put one
patty on each dressed bun, stack the center (non−cheese) patty/bun
on top of the bottom (cheesed) patty/bun. Finish by placing the
toasted crowns on top.

Burger King Breakfast Sandwiches
For the eggs, you will need to create a ring to make them
perfectly round (same as with an Egg McMuffin). Just cut both
ends off tuna cans, clean thoroughly, and you will have a mold
to use. Be sure to use non−stick spray around the sides that
touch the egg. When they're time to flip over, left the can
up and loosen the egg from the can with a knife.
> For The Biscuit Sandwich:
Use Pillsbury "Grands" Buttermilk Biscuits (Five biscuits per can)
1 Egg per biscuit
2 oz. ground breakfast sausage per biscuit, or two slices bacon
1 slice American cheese per biscuit
Prepare biscuits according to package instructions.
Meanwhile, cook bacon and/or sausage. Flatten the sausage out
to be about the same diameter as your tuna cans, and cook.
Beat each egg individually and fry using the molds. Salt and
pepper to your taste.
To assemble, slice biscuit in half; on the bottom, place the egg,
then sausage/bacon, topped with a cheese slice, and then top half
of biscuit. Microwave for about 30 seconds to melt the cheese.
> For the Croissanwich:
To prepare the large croissants, use 1 − 8 ounce can of Pillsbury
Original Crescent Rolls (normally, 8 rolls). Open the can and
separate the dough into four squares (two rolls per square). Take
one square, separate the pieces and turn one 180 degrees around to
form a large triangle. Pinch the dough in the middle to seal, and
roll up starting with the wide end. Then, take both ends and bring
together to form a tight circle. Repeat with others and cook
according to instructions. Top in the same manner as biscuits.

and beat with electric mixer until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, salt
and nutmeg. Stir in additional flour to reach batter consistency (this is
"by look and feel"−− It should still be somewhat sticky...it will pick up
more flour when you roll out the dough on a floured surface). Chill the
dough for several hours or overnight. Take a portion of the dough and rough
out to about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thickness, using flour as needed to prevent
your rolling pin picking up dough. Use a donut cutter and cut out your
donuts. Preheat oil in deep fryer to 375F (use a thermometer if you're using
a fry daddy!). Fry 3−4 donuts at a time −− turning when they are a nice
golden brown. Drain on brown paper bags to remove excess grease.

Carl's Jr's Famous Star
1/4 pound ground chuck
1 large sesame−seed bun
Kraft mayonnaise
Heinz ketchup
Heinz hamburger relish (the red stuff)
Vlasic hamburger slices
tomato, white onion, lettuce
Pre−Prepare your Condiments:
Mix 1 Tablespoon ketchup with 1/2 Tablespoon relish, set aside. Chop the
lettuce...you'll need a handful per burger. Thinly slice the tomato and
onion. You'll need 1−2 tomato slices, and 3−4 rings of fresh onion. (These
amounts are for each Famous Star )
Divide one pound of ground chuck ito 4 equal portions. On waxed paper, form
each portion into 5 inch round patties. Freeze for at least an hour. Keep
any spares frozen until needed. Obviously you'll do this in advance.
When cooking time draws near, toast the faces of the bun (top and bottom) on
a 375 electric griddle. They should be an even tan color.
1. Preheat either an outdoor gas barbecue, or an indoor electric one. After
it is pre−heated, place a still−frozen beef patty on the grill, pressing
down firmly for 4−5 seconds. (This will get you the grill marks) Salt
liberally. Cook for 3 minutes (gas) or 5−6 minutes (electric). Eyeball
it−−−if it looks ready to turn, turn it.
2. While the beef is cooking, dress your bun as follows:
Top Half: Your pre−mixed special sauce (ketchup and relish) 1/2 Tablespoon
mayonnaise
Bottom Half: 1/2 Tablespoon mayonnaise 3 pickle slices 1 handful of chopped
iceberg lettuce 1−2 tomato slices 3−4 fresh rings of onion
3. Turn the beef patty over, press down firmly with a spatula for 3−4
seconds, and salt liberally. (Don't be afraid to have a few flames "kiss"
the burger...they are charbroiled)
4. Place the cooked beef patty on the dressed bottom bun, add the top.

Fried Dough
1/2 cup warm water
5 teaspoons yeast
pinch of sugar
1 cup warm milk
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 eggs
1/3 cup oil
2 cups unbleached all purpose flour
3−4 cups unbleached bread flour (or all−purpose)
oil for frying
granulated sugar for dusting
NOTE: This recipe can also be made in a bread machine on 'dough' cycle.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the yeast, warm water and a
pinch of sugar. Allow to stand a couple of minutes to allow yeast to
swell or dissolve. Stir in remaining sugar, milk, vanilla, eggs, oil,
salt, all−purpose flour and most of bread flour (if using) to make a
soft dough. Knead 5 to 8 minutes by hand or with a dough hook, adding
flour as needed to form a firmer smooth and elastic dough. Place in a
greased bowl. Place bowl in a plastic bag and seal. If not using right
away, you can refrigerate the dough at this point. Let rise about one
hour. Gently deflate dough. If dough is coming out of the refrigerator,
allow to warm about 40 minutes before proceeding.
Cut off portions of dough (about the size of a mandarine orange).
Stretch or roll into large, thin oblong shapes and place on waxed
paper−lined baking sheet. Prepare all dough this way, layering more
paper between the stretched pieces of dough. Cover with a wet towel
and let rest 15 minutes. When oil is hot (385 F) fry slabs, one or two
at a time. Turn them over as soon as they puff up and fry on other side
for a few seconds to complete.
Drain on paper towels. Prepare a bowl with a cup or two of white sugar.
Toss in one at a time and coat well, shaking off excess in the bowl.
You can also serve these with pie toppings or a dollop of strawberry
or raspberry jam.

1 envelope Active dry yeast
1/4 cup Very warm water
1/3 cup Sugar
1/4 cup Butter or margarine
1 teaspoon Salt
1 cup Scalding hot milk
1 Egg −− lightly beaten
4 1/2 cups Sifted all−purpose flour
2 tablespoons Melted butter or margarine −− for brushing rolls
Sprinkle the yeast over very warm water in a large bowl (Very warm
water should feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist.) Stir until
yeast dissolves. Add sugar, the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and salt
to hot milk and stir until the sugar dissolves and butter or margarine
is melted. Cool mixture to 105 to 115 degrees. Add milk mixture to
yeast, then beat in egg. Beat in 4 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time,
to form a soft dough. Use some of the remaining 1/2 cup of the flour to
dust a pastry cloth. Knead the dough lightly for 5 minutes, working in
the remaining flour (use it for flouring the pastry cloth and your
hands). Place dough in a warm buttered bowl; turn greased side up.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/4
to 1 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and knead 4 to 5 minutes on a lightly
floured pastry cloth. Dough will be sticky, but use as little flour
as possible for flouring your hands and the pastry cloth, otherwise
the rolls will not be as feathery light as they should be. Pinch off
small chunks of dough and shape into round rolls about 1 1/2 to
1 3/4 inches in diameter. Place in neat rows, not quite touching,
in a well−buttered 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan. Cover rolls and let rise in
a warm place until doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes. Brush tops of
rolls with melted butter or margarine, then bake in a 375 degree oven
for 18 to 20 minutes or until nicely browned. Serve warm with plenty
of butter. This recipe yields about 2 dozen rolls.

1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce
dash ground pepper
dash garlic powder
1/2 cup all−purpose flour
1/4 teas. paprika
1/4 teas. cayenne pepper
1/4 teas. salt
10 chicken wing pieces
vegetable oil for frying
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375. You want just enough oil to cover the
wings entirely; an inch or so deep at least.
Combine the butter, hot sauce, ground pepper, and garlic powder in a
small saucepan over low heat. Heat until the butter is melted and
the ingredients are well−blended.
Combine the flour, paprika, cayenne powder, and salt in a small bowl.
If the wings are frozen, be sure to defrost and dry them. Put the wings
in a large bowl and sprinkle the flour mixture over them, coating each
wing evenly. Put the wings in the refrigerator 60−90 minutes.
This will help the breading to stick to the wings when fried.
Put all the wings in the hot oil and fry 10 to 15 minutes or until
some parts of the wings begin to turn dark brown. Remove from the oil
to a paper towel to drain. Don't let them sit too long, because you
want to serve them hot. Quickly put the wings in a large bowl. Add the hot
sauce and stir, coating all of the wings evenly.
Serve with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks on the side.

Cooking your Jumbo−Jack
1. Pre−heat an electric griddle to 400 .
2. Toast your buns by laying face down on the griddle for about a minute.
Set aside.
3. Cook the still frozen beef patty 4−5 minutes per side, salting liberally
before and after turning.
4. Dress as follows;
Top Bun
Half of the pre−made mayo sauce 1 Tablespoon chopped, white onion 2 dill

Jack−In−The−Box Tacos
1 Pound Ground beef
1/3 Cup Refried beans
1/4 Teaspoon Salt
2 Tablespoons Chili powder
1/4 Cup Ortega Mild Taco Sauce
12 Soft Corn Tortillas
3 Cups Cooking oil
6 Slices American cheese (each cut in half)
1 Head Lettuce, chopped fine
Slowly brown the beef over low heat, using a wooden spoon to chop
and stir the meat, keeping it very fine and smooth. When the beef is
brown drain the fat. Add the refried beans and use the wooden spoon
to smash the whole beans into the mixture creating a smooth texture.
Add the salt, Chili powder, and Taco Sauce to the mixture.
Remove from the heat.
In another skillet heat 1/4 inch of oil until hot. Test with a
small piece of tortilla − it should bubble when dropped into the oil.
Spread 1/2 of the beef mixture on the center of each corn tortilla.
Fold the tortillas over and press so that the beef fillng acts as an
adhesive and holds the sides together.
Drop each taco into the pan of hot oil and fry on both sides until
crispy. When cooked, remove the tacos from the oil and place them on a
rack or some paper towels until they are a little cooler.
Pry open slightly and add 1/2 slice American cheese and some lettuce.
Top with additional Taco Sauce to taste.

Jalapeno Poppers
6 large Jalapenos
6 slices Monterey Jack or Mozzarella cheese (1/2" thick)
flour for dredging
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 large or 3 small eggs, separated
Place peppers in a bowl and add scalding water to cover. Let stand
30 minutes to 1 hour until softened. Leave stems on and slit down
one side removing and discarding all the seeds.
Place one slice of cheese inside each pepper, and dust with flour.
Heat the oil.
Beat the egg yolks until thick and lemon colored. Beat the whites
until they stand in peaks. Fold the yolks into the whites and dip
each pepper in the egg mixture until well coated.
Fry at once in hot oil turning once and spooning oil over the
uncooked places. Cook until golden brown.

Jerk Seasonings
1/2 cup ground allspice berries [not allspice powder; whole
allspice − ground (use a coffee grinder)]
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
6−8 garlic cloves
4−6 Scotch bonnet peppers (or jalapeno), stems and seeds removed
1 tablespoon ground thyme or 2 tablespoons thyme leaves
2 bunches escallions (green onions)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoon soy sauce to moisten
Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth.
Feel free to adjust amount of peppers or garlic.
Rub the meat (chicken, pork or beef) with the seasoning. If using
pork shoulder, score the fat and rub in. With chicken, be sure
to rub under skin and in cavities. Can also be used with fish, but
use a firm−fleshed fish like grouper.
Marinate overnight. Grill over a low fire until done. Charcoal is best,
but not essential. Meat will be smoked "pinkish" when done, and
the skin will be nice and dark. Chop meat into pieces, and serve
traditionally with hard−dough bread and Jamaican Red Stripe Beer.

Kettle Corn
Place oil and popcorn in a large skillet that has a tight fitting lid.
The popcorn should barely cover the bottom surface. Heat over
medium until the first kernel starts to pop. Quickly stir in the sugar
until dissolved. Cover and continuously shake skillet while holding
top. Be careful, this will burn much quicker than regular popcorn.
When you think all is popped, remove from heat. Spoon the popped
corn into a bowl while shaking once in a while to let the uncooked
kernels settle. Salt lightly, and break up into pieces.

it's very hot (around 350 degrees).
Fry the wings until they're golden brown. Remove and
drain on paper towels.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

KFC Original Fried Chicken
2−3 pounds cut−up chicken pieces
1 Quart Water
3 tablespoons Salt (for soaking)
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon Accent (MSG)
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
Soybean Oil (no substitutions) for frying
Allow chicken to soak in salted water for a half hour.
Mix egg and milk in a bowl. Mix flour, Accent, salt, and pepper
in another bowl. Preheat deep fryer to 350F, or place 3/4 inch
oil in a skillet set on medium.
Dry chicken with paper towels. Dredge in flour mixture, place in
milk/eggs, and then back to flour mixture. Do this one piece at
a time making sure that there is total coverage over entire
surface of chicken in each step.
KFC uses pressure cookers to fry chicken, which is risky to do
at home. If you are using a deep fryer, fry a few pieces at a
time for about 20 minutes, covered, turning occasionally.
Likewise, if pan frying, cook, covered, turning occasionally
for about 30 minutes. As always with chicken, check the middle
of a large piece to check for doneness.
Allow to drain on paper towels when cooking is completed.

McDonald's Big Mac
1 regular sized sesame seed bun
1 regular sized plain bun
2 previously frozen regular beef patties
2 tablespoons Big Mac sauce
2−teaspoons reconstituted onions
1 slice real American cheese
2 hamburger pickle slices
1/4 Cup −shredded iceberg lettuce
Discard the crown half of the regular bun, retaining the heel. The cooking
method for the Big Mac is basically the same as the regular burgers, only
the bun toasting method is slightly different. In the Big Mac's case you
toast the bottom (heel) first. Do this along with the extra heel. (this will
be your middle bun.) You can use the crown (top) as the middle bun also,
just cut the rounded side off. However you will have to toast both sides of it.
Cook the two−all−beef−patties just like the regular burgers. After the bun
parts are toasted, put 1 tablespoon of "Mac sauce" on each of the
heels.(toasted side.) Then add 1/8 cup shredded lettuce to each.On the true
bottom bun, place one thin slice of American cheese on top of the lettuce.
On the extra "heel", the middle bun, place two pickle slices on top of the
lettuce. Toast the "crown" (top) of the bun also. When the meat patties are
done, place them one at a time on both prepared buns. Stack the middle bun
on top of the bottom bun, and put the crown on top.

McDonald's Hot Apple & Cherry Pies
4−6 Cups vegetable oil (in fryer)
1 package Pillsbury apple or cherry turnovers
(Find them in the refrigerated section)
1. Unroll the Pillsbury turnover dough. You will have six 3"x3" pieces. You
will use four of them. Stretch them out to about 4"x5" rectangles. Do this
on waxed paper.
2. Spread 1/2 of the pie filling on one dough, and the other half on
another, leaving about 1/2" of dough around edges. Clear a 3/4" space
lengthwise down the middle of both.
3. Place the remaining two doughs on top of the two with the filling. Crimp
the edges. You'll have what looks like two giant pop−tarts.
4. Cut both of them precisely down the middle, in that 3/4" space you
created. Crimp those two edges.
5. Manipulate as needed to form an attractive, uniform shaped pie. They
should look like small burritos, only crimped around the edges.
6. Place all four, flat on waxed paper, in the freezer. After about 45
minutes, spray all sides of each pie with water mist. Return to the freezer
for at least another hour.
7. Place in a freezer bag and seal for future use, or get ready to deep−fry
them.
Cooking Your Pies:
1. Pre−heat your deep fryer to 375 . Also pre−heat your oven to warm.
2. Quickly dip a frozen pie in cold water, making sure to immerse it
entirely.
3. Drop the pie into the hot oil. Be careful−−−it will most likely splatter.
After all the pies are in the fryer, place your spare fryer basket over the
top. ("Sandwiching" the pies between the two baskets.) This ensures the pies
are fully submerged. It is important that the pies are fully submerged or a
good portion of it won't cook correctly.
4. Cook 5−7 minutes. Check after 5 minutes−−−the color should be a golden

10 hamburger buns (local grocery type)
10 hamburger dill slices (more or less to taste)
10 teaspoons dried, chopped (not minced) onions
Mustard
Ketchup
Salt, Pepper, and MSG
Divide 1 lb of beef into 10 equal sized balls. Form a patty out of
each ball about 4 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Do this
on waxed paper. Now freeze the patties for at least an hour
(this keeps them from falling apart when grilled).
Combine dried onions with water in a small container. Add enough
water so the onions can hydrate (You can't add too much, just be
sure to drain well before using).
Preheat a griddle or skillet to medium−high. In the meantime,
toast the hamburger buns until just golden.
Lay the frozen patties on the hot surface. After about 20 seconds,
"sear" them by applying even pressure with the back of a metal
spatula; do this only for about 2 seconds. After searing them,
sprinkle generously with salt, pepper, and MSG to taste.
After about one minute since searing the patties, turn them over.
Careful, don't tear the side you seared. Add about a teaspoon of
your prepared onions on top.
Quickly dress your buns. On the crown part of buns (top),
Mustard first....five "kisses" the diameter of a pencil evenly
spaced in a circle about a half inch from the edge. Then the Ketchup,
five squirts the size of a nickle.. in the pattern found on dice.
Place the pickle in the middle.
By the time you finish that, the meat will be done (about 1 minute
or 1:10 after turning). Remove the meat and tilt to the side to allow
excess fat to drain off. Use your free hand to hold down the onions.
Place patties onion side up on the dressed crown, top with toasted
heels (the burger will be upside−down). Flip upright and serve.

Parafin Wax (Parawax)
Semi−sweet Baking Chocolate
Food Coloring
Artifical Food Flavors
The above ingredients are approximate quantities only!!! For every cup of
icing sugar you use, mix in approximately 1 teaspoon of softened butter or
margarine. Then slowly mix in enough of the evaporated milk to make the
mixture of a consistency such that you can form a ball with it. (Mixing with
the hands is the easiest way). Next seperate the mixture into as many parts
(3 or 4) as you want different flavored chocolates. Then slowly knead in the
desired flavoring and food color you want in each different part. Now mold
the resultant mixture into the desired shapes and sizes you want your
chocolates to be. Now melt in a double boiler (or microwave) two parts
semi−sweet chocolate to one part parawax. Remove from heat. Immediately,
using a tooth pick, pick up each shape created above and dip it into the
chocolate mixture to coat them. Then put them on a piece of wax paper until
the chocolate coating is set. As the chocolate mixture cools and thickens,
reheat it and continue. If you run out of chocolate mixture, simply add more
chocolate and parawax in the proportions listed above.
Note: Suggested flavors and colors: − Maple flavor with no coloring − Mint
flavor with green coloring − Lemon flavor with yellow coloring − Orange
flavor with orange coloring − Almond Flavoring with red coloring (small
amount to create pink)
Variations: − With the Maple flavoring, you can bury a piece of pecan or
walnut inside the candy before dipping it into the chocolate − With the
almond flavoring, bury a marachino cherry inside the candy before dipping it
in the chocolate. Add a drop of cherry juice with it to prevent the cherry
being too dry. − Use the same recipe to make Easter eggs, bunnies etc. Ex.
For Easter eggs, make a center part of one color and flavor and wrap it in
another color and flavor before dipping.
Note: Parawax must be used with the chocolate to create a consistency that
will stick to your candy and not your fingers when set. It is not harmful
and is used commercially.

COOKIE WAFERS:
1 (18.25 oz) box Dark Fudge Cake Mix
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons shortening
CREME FILLING:
3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup shortening (no substitution)
3 tablespoons hot water
Preheat oven to 325F. Blend all ingredients; then knead with your
hands until it is pliable like dough. Form dough into 3/4 inch balls
and press flat, 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Bottom of
a glass works nice for this. Bake 4 to 6 minutes or until cookies are
crunchy. I should think you could refrigerate the dough in cylinder
shaped rolls for a couple of hours and slice 1/8 inch thick, as well.
Let cookies cool on sheets.
Combine filling ingredients and mix well. Form into balls about 1/2 to
3/4 inch in diameter, again using your hands. Sandwich one
filling in the center of two cookies and carefully press down until
the filling spreads almost to the edge.

Outback Steakhouse Aussie Fries
1 − 2 lb. bag of Frozen French Fries
1 Cup shredded Colby Jack cheese
6 pieces of Bacon, cooked
24 Fl. Oz. Peanut Oil (can be reused later; store in refrigerator)
Divide the fries into half, and use the other half later.
Heat oil to 350 degrees. If you do not have a thermostat, make sure
the oil is hot enough, so that when you set a french fry in there it
will cook immediately. If the french fry sinks to the bottom, and
barely bubbles, it is not hot enough. Fry the potatoes in small
batches, they are done when they are golden brown, and float to the
top of the skillet. ( I like to use a Dutch Oven). Be sure to drain
the potatoes on paper towels. You can keep them warm in the oven
while the other fries are done.
When all french fries are done cooking, and drained place them onto
a platter. Salt the french fries if you like, and sprinkle on cheese
and cooked bacon. Pop these back into a warm oven until the cheese
begins to melt.

Honey Mustard Marinade:
1/2 cup Grey Poupon Dijon mustard
1/2 cup honey
1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
Chicken:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups sliced mushrooms (10−12 mushrooms)
2 tablespoons butter
salt and pepper
paprika
8 slices bacon, cooked
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley
Using an electric mixer, combine mustard, honey, 1 1/2 teaspoons
oil and lemon juice in small bowl. Whip mixture for about
30 seconds. Pour about 2/3 of marinade over the chicken breasts
and marinate them (covered) in the refrigerator, for about 2 hours.
Chill remaining marinade until later. After the chicken has marinated,
preheat oven to 375 F and heat up an ovenproof frying pan
(large enough to hold all four breasts) with 1teaspoon of oil over
medium heat. If you dont have an ovenproof skillet, transfer the
chicken to a baking dish for the baking. Sear chicken in pan for 3−4
minutes per side or until golden brown. Remove the pan from heat,
but keep the chicken in the pan. As the chicken is cooking,
saute the sliced mushrooms in butter in a small frying pan.
Brush each seared chicken breast with a little of the reserved honey
mustard marinade (not the portion the chicken marinated in), being
sure to save a little extra to serveas a side. Season chicken
with salt, pepper, and a dash of paprika. Stack two pieces of
cooked bacon, crosswise, on each chicken breast. Spoon the
sauteed mushrooms on the bacon, being sure to coat each breast
evenly. Spread 1/4 cup Monterey Jack cheese onto each
breast, followed by 1/4 cup of Cheddar. Bake the pan of chicken
for 7−10 minutes or until the cheese is thoroughly melted and
starting to bubble. Sprinkle each chicken breast with 1/2 teaspoon

Sun Dried Tomatoes
Dried Tomatoes (yields about 1 pint)
Wash carefully and wipe dry:
7 or 8 pounds of firm, ripe (preferably Roma) tomatoes.
Cut out the stem and scar and the hard portion of core lying under it.
Cut the tomatoes in half, lengthwise. If the tomato is more than about
2 inches long, cut it in quarters.
Scrape out all of the seeds that you can without removing the pulp.
Arrange the tomatoes, with the cut surface up, on non−stick cookie
sheets (glass or porcelin dishes are OK. They will have to withstand
temperatures of a few hundred degrees F if you are going to oven−dry
the tomatoes). Do *not* use aluminum foil, or bare aluminum cookie
sheets. The acid in the tomatoes will react with the metal.
Mix together thoroughly:
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried thyme
2 tsp salt.
Sprinkle a small amount of this mixture on each tomato.
(You may customize this mixture to suit your own taste.)
Dry the tomatoes in the oven, dehydrator, or in the sun. Directions
follow for each of these methods. However, no matter what method you
choose, be aware that not all of the tomatoes will dry at the same rate.
They do not all have the same amount of moisture, nor do they experience
the same temperature and air circulation while they are drying.
They are done when they are very dry, but still pliable − about the
texture of a dried apricot. If dried too long, they become tough and
leathery. If not dried long enough, they will mold and mildew, unless
packed in oil. So watch them carefully while they dry. Try to remove
them on an individual basis, before they become tough.
Here are the drying methods. There is a time listed with each method.
This time is approximate, and can vary significantly depending on the
Sun Dried Tomatoes

415

Insider's Recipes Master Edition

moisture of the tomato. Do *not* rely on this time as more than a
rough guide.
Oven−drying (approximately 12 hours):
Bake, cut side up, in 170 F oven for about 3 hours. Leave the
oven door propped open about 3 inches to allow moisture to
escape. After 3 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat
with your hand or a spatula. Continue to dry, turning the
tomatoes every few hours, and gently pressing flatter and
flatter, until tomatoes are dry.
Dehydrator method (approximately 8 hours):
Place the tomatoes, cut side up, directly onto the dehydrator
trays. Set dehydrator temperature to about 140 F. After 4 or
5 hours, turn the tomatoes over and press flat with your hand
or a spatula. After a few hours, turn the tomatoes again and
flatten gently. Continue drying until done.
Sun−drying (approximately 3 days):
Dry in hot weather, with relatively low humidity.
Place tomatoes, cut side down, in shallow wood−framed trays
with nylon netting for the bottom of the trays. Cover trays
with protective netting (or cheesecloth). Place in direct sun,
raised from the ground on blocks or anything else that allows
air to circulate under the trays. Turn the tomatoes over after
about 1 1/2 days, to expose the cut side to the sun. Place the
trays in a sheltered spot after sundown, or if the weather
turns bad.
After the tomatoes are dry, store in air−tight containers, or pack
in oil.
To pack in oil:
Dip each tomato into a small dish of white wine vinegar. Shake off the
excess vinegar and pack them in olive oil. Make sure they are
completely immersed in the oil.
When the jar is full, cap it tightly and store at *cool* room
temperature for at least a month before using. They may be stored in

temperatures (it quickly reliquifies at room temperature however).
As tomatoes are removed from the jar, add more olive oil as necessary
to keep the remaining tomatoes covered.

Thomas English Muffins
1 lb. All−purpose or bread flour
1 teas. Salt
1 1/2 Tbl. Dry yeast
1 teas. Sugar
1 cup Warm milk
2 oz. Butter, melted
Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and leave in a warm place. Dissolve
the yeast and sugar in warm (105 F) milk (M−Waved). Let froth,
then mix in the butter. Stir all the liquid into the warm flour and beat
well until smooth and elastic. Cover and proof in a warm place for 50
minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well−floured board and
knead, working a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier
to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage shape and (using
the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10 portions, each about 1 1/2
to 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round with straight sides. Put
onto a greased baking sheet. Cover (use greased plastic wrap) and put
in a warm place to proof for 30−40 minutes or until springy to the touch.
Leave room for expansion and be careful not to over−proof, as the muffins
will get flabby and lose their shape. Warm and grease the bakestone
lightly. Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very
moderate heat for 8−10 minutes until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook
the other side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches. To
serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly apart,
and insert slivers of butter.

Tony Roma's Baby Back Ribs
Begin the day before, by preheating the oven to 500 degrees (that's
right). I normally use two racks of baby back pork ribs (they may
be dry−rubbed or just use salt and pepper). Take a 2−piece broiling
pan, pour about 1/2 inch of water in the lower portion and put the
upper half, the part with the drain holes, in place. Now, lay the two
racks of ribs side by side on top. Avoid overlapping them or
hanging them off the edge of the pan. Form a tent and seal tightly
around the perimeter of the broiler with extra heavy−duty aluminum
foil. You may need to fold two sheets together to get enough width.
It is crucial that the seal is tight! If the water evaporates, the end
product will suffer (not to mention you and your guests). Also,
make sure that the foil does not lay on the ribs.
Bake for one hour, exactly. This essentially steams the ribs at high
temp. Cool the ribs, still covered, remove them from the pan, then
wrap tighly and chill overnight in the fridge. This step is important.
The ribs must be cold for the next phase. You can reserve the
liquid, which is basically rib stock, reduce/strain and add to the
barbecue sauce if you like. It adds a unique, meaty flavor.
Start your grill. I prefer charcoal, you may prefer wood or gas. You
want a hot grill for this and you'll need to be attentive because
timing is of the essence here. Place the racks on the grill and when
they reach a golden, bubbly stage (3−4 min.), turn them and coat
with a good barbecue sauce. Bullseye Original works well, but I've
found that any quality sauce will do fine, so use your favorite. After
the other side has browned, turn and coat it. Cook the sauce into
the ribs for a couple of minutes on each side, then remove, slice and
serve. A word of caution: The ribs will be so tender that the meat
will literally fall off the bone when you try to turn the racks on the
grill. It is helpfull to have two sets of large tongs and be very, very
gentle.

Twix Bars
35 individual Kraft caramels
1/4 cup water
1 box Nabisco Lorna Doone shortbread (about 40)
2 − 12 oz. bags milk chocolate chips
Combine the caramels with the water in a small pan and melt over
low heat. Place the shortbread cookies side by side on an ungreased
cookie sheet. Spoon a small amount of caramel onto each cookie.
Refrigerate cookies until the caramel is firm.
In the meantime, in a double boiler over low heat, melt the chocolate
chips. You may also use the microwave for melting the chocolate.
Just heat the chips for 1 minute on high, stir, then heat for
another minute.
Remove the cookies from the refrigerator. Rest each one on a fork and
dip it into the chocolate. Tap the fork on the side of the pan or bowl
to knock off any excess chocoloate. Then place each one on a sheet
of waxed paper and let them cool at room temperature (65−70F).
This could take several hours, but the bars will set best this way.
If you want to speed up the process, put the candy in the
refrigerator for 30 minutes.

White Castle Sliders
Get a pound of 85% lean ground beef, and divide into 16 equal sized pieces.
Form each into a 2−1/2 inch square patties. Do this on waxed paper. Make
the patties very thin. Then "cookie−cut" five holes in each pattie.
(the pattern should resemble 5 on a dice) A CLEAN pen cap works nicely.
Freeze these 16 patties. (It'll make it easier later)
BUNS: the buns are also small. My grocer has dinner rolls the exact size
I need, but you might have to create your own using hot dog buns. One
hot−dog bun makes two White Castle buns. Simply cut in half (through top
and bottom) and then cut off the rounded sides to make them square.
COOKING: This is key. You need to finely chop a medium white onion.
On a pre−heated 375 degree electric griddle, lay about 1−1/2 Tablespoons
of onion for each patty you want to cook (generously spray with non−stick
spray like Pam first) The onions should only be "one deep" if you will.
Immediately place frozen patty directly on top of onions and press down.
Cook for about 4 minutes right on top of the onions. The holes in the beef
will allow the steam to cook the top side. (You don't flip)
Add a dash of salt and a pinch of pepper to each patty while they cook.
Remove and place on UNTOASTED buns.

Zwieback
1 Package (2−1/4 teaspoons) active Dry yeast
1/4 Cup Plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 Cup Warm water
1 Cup Plus 2 Tablespoons milk
4 Tablespoon (1/2 stick) butter or Margarine
1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla extract
1/8 Teaspoon Ground mace
1/8 Teaspoon Ground cinnamon
1/8 Teaspoon Ground nutmeg
1 Egg, lightly beaten
3 3/4 Cup All−purpose flour
2 Tablespoon Butter, melted, for glazing
The method for making Zwieback is quite different from that for most other
crackers. "Zwieback" means "twice baked." First you bake a yeast bread,
aromatically flavored with nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and mace. Then you
slice it and slowly dry the slices in a slow oven. For convenience, make the
bread over a two−day period. Bake the bread the first day and dry it the
second. If stored in an airtight container, Zwieback will keep almost
indefinitely. In a small bowl, combine the yeast with 1/2 teaspoon of the
sugar and the warm water. Set aside in a warm place until the mixture starts
to foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. In a small saucepan, mix the milk and the
remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar. Add the 4 Tablespoons butter and heat until
the butter has completely melted. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow
to cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the
cooled milk mixture with the yeast mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Add the
mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix well. Beat in the egg. Slowly add the
flour, adding just enough to make a smooth dough that is not sticky. If
mixing by hand, the dough will become too stiff to stir, and you should
knead in the last of the flour with your fingers. Then knead well for at
least 5 minutes, forming the dough into a ball. If using a food processor,
pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. Place the dough in a large,
lightly oiled bowl and turn it over to coat all sides. Cover with a damp
towel and set the dough in a warm place until it has doubled in bulk, about
1−1/2 to 2 hours. Punch the dough down and knead a few strokes. Cover and
allow the dough to double in size again, 30 to 45 minutes. Punch the dough
down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface or pastry cloth. Knead
about 30 seconds to remove the air. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions.
With your hands, roll each into a smooth cylinder or loaf about 2 inches
thick and 9 inches long. Place the loaves crosswise on a lightly greased or

parchment−lined baking sheet, leaving at least 3 inches between the loaves.
Brush all exposed surfaces of each loaf with the melted butter. Set the
baking sheet in a warm place and let the loaves rise until doubled in bulk,
about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the risen loaves for 25 to
30 minutes, or until the bottoms are reddish brown and make a hollow sound
when thumped. Allow the loaves to cool thoroughly on racks. Preheat the oven
to 200F. Cut the cooled loaves into 1/2−inch slices. Place the slices flat
on the baking sheet and allow them to dry out in the oven for 45 to 60
minutes, or until thoroughly dry. Check occasionally and turn the slices
over as they dry on one side. When dry, raise the oven temperature to 300F.

1 small carrot
1/2 lb. mushrooms
1/2 cup stock or boullion
1 tbsp. dark soy sauce
1 tbsp. Dijon mustard

mixture.) Stir well and pour into a non−stick skillet coated with
cooking spray. (For best results, use an egg ring that has been
sprayed with cooking spray. The egg ring will shape the egg to fit
the muffin.)

and pulse four or five times until ingredients are chopped fine
but not pureed. Pour the mixture in a bowl and add the steamed
onion and cornstarch, blending well.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Spray a large skillet with olive
oil cooking spray and place it over medium−low heat. Measure a

Orange Scented Gravy
1−2 cups fat free and low sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoons flour
1/3 cup Madeira
Salt and pepper for seasoning
Set oven temperature to 325 degrees. Combine the orange peel, garlic
powder, coriander, cinnamon, salt, white pepper, cardamom and cayenne
pepper together in a small bowl. Set aside a large roasting pan fitted
with a rack. Remove the giblets from inside the chicken. Discard or
reserve for another use. Rinse the bird inside and out with cold
running water. Place on a working surface and pat dry with paper
towels. Remove any visible fat with poultry shears. Very carefully
loosen the skin from around the breast, thigh, leg and neck areas with
a spoon without tearing the skin. Season the inside cavity with about
1/3 of the spice mixture. Rub the remaining mixture under the skin as
evenly as possible. Lightly oil the outside with canola oil. Tuck the
wings under the bird and tie the legs together loosely. Place in the
roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes per pound or until the internal
temperature registers 180F degrees. Use an instant read thermometer
placed between the thigh and the body without touching bone. Remove
the bird from the oven, transfer to a carving board, cover with
aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes before carving.
Pour the pan juices into a bowl. Let the juices settle. The fat will
float to the top. Skim off the fat with a spoon or use a turkey baster
to siphon the juices from the bottom of the bowl. Add enough chicken
broth to measure 2 1/2 cups and pour into a saucepan. Add the orange
juice and bring to a boil. Mix the flour and Madeira together to make

2 cups of water
2 tablespoons of good (not cooking) Sherry

two tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy skillet. Remove from pan and
put steak in and turn heat up high and brown steak well. Remove steak from
pan and add the wine or Sherry and boil down to evaporate, add water and
scrape the pan to get the brown etc. mixed well with the water. Add the
steak and browned onion/garlic. Add 1/2 to full can of the tomato sauce
depending on your taste, it steak isn't covered with the liquid, add more
water. Let simmer for several hours, (adding water if too much evaporates)
keep a cover on the skillet, but leave it slightly cracked to allow steam
to escape. One hour into the cooking, remove one cup of liquid and reserve
for later use. Taste steak occasionaly till very tender, then add mushrooms
and pepper strips to mixture and let it cook till they are tender/crisp.
At the time you add the last two ingredients mix 2-4 tablespoons of cornstarch with the reserved liquid (which should have cooled by this time)
and slowly add this mixture to the pepper steak to thicken the dish and
cook at least (bubbling) 10 min. serve over rice, with a green salad
dressed with oil and vinegar, you've got a great meal1

Use for 4-6 servings:
1kg
piece of beef (e.g. from the upper back hip, no usual roast beef!)
1/4 l
vinegar from red whine or a mixture 50:50 red whine and vinegar
2 bay
leafs
2 tblsp whole black pepper
2 big
onions
1 big

1. Place meat in a high dish, fill with vinegar (or mixture)
until covered. Add bay leafs and pepper grains and place dish in the
refrigerator. Leave there for 2-3 days, turn meat around at least once.
2. Get meat out of marinade and dry. Spice meat with pepper all around.
3. Cut onions, carrots and potatoes in little cubes.
Heat oil, place meat in it and roast until brown from all sides.
Add onions until brown, too.
4. Salt the meat, add potatoes and carrots, then the bouillon, and, optionally,
some more red whine (esp. if you used only vinegar before).
Add also a little of the marinade (without leafs and pepper).
5. Simmer for at least 1 1/2 hours on low heat in a closed pot, turn once.
6. Get meat out of the pot and keep warm.
Puree the sauce, let reduce a little. Add creme fraiche or sour creme,

7. Cut meat into slices, serve.
Traditional side dishes are potatoes or Kloesse (dumplings),
and some vegetable like Rotkraut (that is hot red crabbage).
In some areas of germany, they add raisins and sliced apples to the sauce
so that it gets a more sweet-and-sour taste.
Enjoy.

German Sauerbraten
From: marple@cs.ubc.ca (Kirk Marple)

Someone from Germany posted a sauerbraten recipe which is probably more
authentic than this, but ginger snaps in sauerbraten seem to be a real
American tradition (according to Fanny Farmer, which is where I got this)!
Laura
marple@cs.ubc.ca
Sauerbraten
Serves: 10
4 lb. top or bottom round roast
1 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
10 peppercorns, crushed
1 onion, sliced thin
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons pickling spices
2 cups water
3 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup gingersnaps, crushed fine
1/2 cup sour cream
Two days before you plan to use it, put the beef in a deep glass or pottery
bowl. In a saucepan, mix the wine, salt, peppercorns, onion, bay leaves
and pickling spices with 2 cups water and bring to a boil. Remove from the
heat. When it is cool, pour over the beef. Cover the bowl tightly with foil,
and refrigerate for at least two days, turning the meat in the marinade twice
a day.
Preheat the oven to 350. Melt the shortening in a covered roasting pan or
casserole. Remove the meat from the marinade, pat it dry with paper towels,
and brown it well on all sides in the hot shortening. Drain off the fat,
strain the marinade, and pour it over the meat. Cover and cook in the oven
for 2-2 1/2 hours, or until tender.
Remove the meat and keep warm on a platter. Put the roasting pan on a burner
and add the gingersnap crumbs, stirring until the gravy is smooth and
thickened. Stir in the sour cream, letting it get hot, but not allowing it
to boil, lest it curdle. Slice the meat, pour the gravy into a sauce bowl,
and serve with the sauerbraten.

Buffalo Wings
From: stevew@rb-csd.sandiegoca.ncr.com

This is a wing recipe from a guy who used to cook wings for a living in
Buffalo.
Get some Durkee's Frank's Original Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce, there
is "no" adequate substitute, you may have to ask your grocer to order it,
or call Durkee/French's at 714-526-3363. If it's the little bottles, get
two or three of them, I get the gallon jug from a restaurant supply place,
cheap!
It used to be called Frank's Red Hot Pepper Sauce, then it was
Durkee's Louisiana Hot Sauce, but there already was a brand name Louisiana
Hot Sauce. Still tastes the same!
Acquire some margarine.
resistance to burning).

Only margarine works right (correct taste and
Neither oil nor butter will substitute.

Get the wings cut up, and start heating up the frying grease. Some
revisionist (or health-conscious) types insist on other cooking methods,
but there is nothing like the real crisp-on-the-outside moist
-and-chewy-on-the-inside texture of fried wings.
Make up the sauce. Put the Durkee's and margarine into a skillet or
saute pan big enough to comfortably hold one fryer-load of wings. The
total amount of sauce at once should be about a quarter of an inch in the
bottom of the pan.
The proportions are:
Equal parts is the nominal starting point (called "medium" in Buffalo).
A bit of tingle, but not very spicy.
Undiluted Durkee's doesn't taste as good, but is pretty hot.
one, Durkee's to margarine is about as hot as I like it.

Three to

For the really timid (like kids) just a splash of Durkee's in the margarine
gives a little flavor but no noticeable hot. The idea is to cook up the
Durkee's and margarine to a bit thicker consistency. It should simmer for
5 minutes or so, then be kept hot.
You can make up just one batch of sauce for a bunch of wings. You can just
add more ingredients to the pan as you use up the sauce. When you add more
ingredients, you can adjust the spiciness.
I use this to satisfy everybody, I start out with all the margarine I plan

to use, and put in just a splash of Durkee's. That makes a few wings for
the kids. Then a bunch more Durkee's to make the wings medium. Still more
Durkee's to get it the way I like it.
Fry the wings. They're cooked when the bubbles slow down significantly.
This takes seeing it once to know just how much bubbling corresponds to
"done," but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to get it right. At home,
I put the "drumettes" in first, because they take a minute or two longer
to cook. As always with frying, be sure that you don't put in so much
food that the temperature of the fat drops below 325 or so, and have the
heat on so it gets back up to 375 ASAP.
As the wings finish cooking, take them out and drain thoroughly. I
generally put them in a strainer held over the fat. Don't pile them up
in a bowl, or the fat will cool and congeal before it runs off!
Once the wings are drained, put them in the sauce and get the wings covered
with sauce. The official restaurant way to do this is to toss them in the
air, but your stove cleaner may not appreciate this.
Use tongs to pick the wings out of the pan and let the sauce drain off.
Toss the wings on a grill or in a hot oven for a few minutes at this point
to "bake on" the sauce.
Serve with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing on the side. Yes, the
BCD *is* for the wings! But make sure it is good BCD, with nice chunks of
good cheese. (One of the sadder realizations of my growing up is that there
are some things you just can't get, restaurants get a special Kraft dressing
that comes only in five-gallon containers that must be continuously
refrigerated. Great stuff, not available to you and me.)

Date: Wed, 8 Sep 1993 13:53:39 GMT

Here is the original recipe created by Ms. Teresa Bellissimo, owner of
the Anchor Bar and Restaurant, in Buffalo, NY. It is taken from
Totally Hot! The Ultimate Hot Pepper Cookbook.
4 to 5 Lbs Chicken wings
Freshly ground black pepper
Salt (if desired)
4 C
Vegetable Oil
4 Tbs butter or margarine (1/2 stick)
5 Tbs Louisiana-brand hot sauce or Tabasco sauce
1 Tbs white wine vinegar
1. Chop off the tip of each chicken wing, and discard it. Chop the wing
in half (cutting at the joint) to make 2 pieces. Grind on fresh black
pepper and sprinkle with salt if desired.
2. Heat the oil over high heat in a deep skillet, Dutch oven, or deep-fat
fryer until it starts to pop and sizzle (around 400 degrees F). Add
half the chicken wings and cook until they're golden and crisp,
stirring or shaking occasionally. When done, remove them to drain on
paper towels and cook the remaining wings.
3. Melt the butter or margarine over medium heat in a heavy saucepan, add
the hot sauce and the 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Stir well and remove from
the flame immediately.
4. Place the chicken on a warm serving platter, pour the sauce on top, and
serve

(4-6 Servings)
24 wings
4 cups oil (peanut, corn, or other)
4 tbs. butter
1 tbs. white vinegar
2-5 tbs. (one 2.5 oz. bottle) Frank's Louisiana Hot Sauce
2.5 cups blue cheese dressing (Marie's or see recipe below)
salt and pepper
celery sticks
Discard small tip of each wing, split at large joint and
sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in large casserole or fryer (until quite hot). Add
half of wings and cook, stirring occasionally. When brown and crisp
(15-20 min.), remove and drain well. Cook remaining wings.
Melt butter in saucepan and add hot sauce and vinegar.
Put wings on a warm platter and pour sauce over them (or put
wings and sauce in a closed container and shake).
Serve with celery sticks, blue cheese dressing (for dipping),
and beer.

Blue Cheese Dressing
1 cup mayonnaise (Hellman's or homemade, see below)
2 tbs. finely chopped onion
1 tsp. finely minced garlic
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tbs. lemon juice
1 tbs. white vinegar
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
salt, pepper, cayenne to taste
Combine and chill for an hour or longer.

Makes 2.5 cups.

Buffalo Chicken Wings

1 egg yolk
1 tsp. vinegar or lemon juice
salt and freshly ground pepper

1 tsp. Dijon mustard
1 cup oil (peanut, olive,
or other)

Beat egg yolk, mustard, salt, pepper and vinegar (or lemon
juice) for a few seconds with wire whisk or beater.
Add oil gradually and continue beating to correct consistency.
Makes 1 cup.

The unfortunate part of the referenced recipe is that it is loaded
with fat. For a low(er) fat variation that still tastes good, (got
rave reviews when we served them at our last party) broil the wings
instead of frying them, and then mix 1/2 cup hot sauce, 4 tbs honey,
2 tbs vinegar, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1 heaping tsp dry mustard, like
Coleman's. Heat the sauce until it thickens, and then put the wings
in, and then cook till it thickens even more, while stirring the
wings around. Still taste good with celery sticks and blue cheese
dressing. Might as well go all the way and use lower fat cheese
dressing, though.
Wings, being mostly chicken skin, have a large amount of fat in
them, no matter what you do. You can help a little by broiling them
so that some of the fat melts away, and not
adding any more. I would recommend grilling the wings. That way,
you lose the fat (a good thing) without losing the flavor (which
would be a bad thing).

BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD
=====================
Marinate a few boneless chicken breasts in Durkee's Red Hot Sauce (I
swear by the stuff at work, I should have known it was the best for
Buffalo Wings - it is great in Crab Dip, too) and a little olive oil,

lemon juice, salt and pepper.
I like to let the chicken sit overnight so that it soaks up the true
flavor of the durkee's. Bake off the chicken at 350 until cooked
through, and no pink shows. Let cool and tear into pieces, drizzling
more Durkee's if the flavor is not enough.
Then I just toss it with chopped celery, and homemade blue cheese
dressing. The dressing certainly does not have a recipes (We really
don't use recipes in catering) - basically it is Mayo, Sour Cream,
Chopped Green onion, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and crumbled blue cheese
- Saga Blue usually. The secret is to let the blue cheese set in the
fridge at least overnight.

with your hands until chicken is completely coated and seasonings are
well distributed. (Make sure the chicken wings are at room temperature;
otherwise, the seasoning mixture will congeal and you'll have a mess of
gunk that won't stick well to the chicken.) Set aside to marinate (for
up to 30 minutes, covered) and heat the oil.
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat until it is very
hot. Add the chicken wings, fitting in as many as there is room for in
a single layer. Fry until crisp and golden brown, about 8 to 12
minutes, turning several times. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the
remaining wings.
Meanwhile, make a sauce to finish the wings by melting the remaining
butter and adding the remaining Tabasco and seasoning mix. Dip the
cooked wings into the finishing sauce and place on a serving platter.
Serve with the Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks, if desired.
Blue Cheese Dressing:
--------------------2
eggs
1 tblsp fresh lemon juice
1 tblsp apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp white pepper
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp minced fresh garlic
1 tsp
Worcestershire sauce
2 cups
vegetable oil
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
Instructions:
------------Put everything but the oil and blue cheese into a blender or food
processor and process for 15 to 20 seconds. Continue to process, adding
the oil slowly in a thin stream. When oil has been added, process for
an additional 45 seconds, or until well thickened. Add the cheese and
mix well. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Buffalo Chicken Wing Recipes : COLLECTION

-----------24
wings
4 cups
oil (peanut, corn, or other)
4 T
butter
2-5 T
(one 2.5 oz. bottle) Frank's
1 T
white vinegar
Louisiana Hot Sauce
2-1/2 C
Blue Cheese Dressing
salt and pepper
celery sticks
Instructions:
------------Discard small tip of each wing, split at large joint and sprinkle with
salt and pepper. Heat oil in large casserole or fryer (until quite
hot). Add half of wings and cook, stirring occasionally. When brown
and crisp (15-20 min.), remove and drain well. Cook remaining wings.
Melt butter in saucepan and add hot sauce and vinegar. Put wings on a
warm platter and pour sauce over them (or put wings and sauce in a
closed container and shake). Serve with celery sticks, blue cheese
dressing (for dipping), and beer.
The unfortunate part of the referenced recipe is that it is loaded with
fat. For a low(er) fat variation that still tastes good, (got rave
reviews when we served them at our last party) broil the wings instead
of frying them, and then mix 1/2 cup hot sauce, 4 tbs honey, 2 tbs
vinegar, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1 heaping tsp dry mustard, like Coleman's.
Heat the sauce until it thickens, and then put the wings in, and then
cook till it thickens even more, while stirring the wings around. Still
taste good with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Might as well
go all the way and use lower fat cheese dressing, though.
Wings, being mostly chicken skin, have a large amount of fat in them, no
matter what you do. You can help a little by broiling them so that some
of the fat melts away, and not adding any more. I would recommend
grilling the wings. That way, you lose the fat (a good thing) without
losing the flavor (which would be a bad thing).
Blue Cheese Dressing
-------------------1 c
mayonnaise
2 Tbsp
finely chopped onion
1 tsp
finely minced garlic
1/4 c
finely chopped parsley
1/2 c
sour cream
1 Tbsp
lemon juice
1 Tbsp
white vinegar
1/4 c.
crumbled blue cheese
salt, pepper, cayenne to taste

BUFFALO WINGS
=============
If we make them at home we don't usually deep-fry them.
Instead, we bake them for awhile and then broil each side to try and get
them a little crispy. For a sauce, we simply mix some hot sauces and a
little Italian salad dressing until we think it tastes ok and then roll
the wings around in it. They're not bad this way but they're not quite
like you'd get back in NY.

The Sauce:

butter or margarine
1 tblsp
garlic wine vinegar
1 tblsp

1 tblsp

Note:
----Measurements are not critical.
The vinegar makes it aromatic.
The lemon gives it tang.
The red hot gives it bang.
The honey softens the blow.
Instructions:
------------Put all the ingredients in a sauce pan and simmer on low until it is all
melted/mixed well. When you first taste it, it's kind 'nasty'. It
seems to mellow while your deep frying the chicken. Keep warm while

doing the chicken.
2 or 3 packages chicken wing 'drumettes' (or cut whole wings into pieces
do not use the wing tip!)
Deep fry the chicken in peanut oil at 350 deg. In a wok when the
'wingettes' are golden brown and floating, they are done. (When you
first put them in the oil they sink). Drain the batches on paper towels
in a warm oven. Broiling will not create the 'right' texture - they
should be brown and crispy
When all the chicken is done put them in a large bowl and pour the sauce
on them. Toss the chicken to coat all the pieces.

BUFFALO WINGS
=============
Ingredients:
-----------1 Family pack of wings (?lbs)
1 bottle of hot sauce (could use louisana style, I prefer to find or
make one with more of a tomato base than vinegar base. If you like
super hot wings try to find Inner Beauty Sauce)
1 stick of margarine or butter (margarine works better)
Instructions:
------------Deep fry the wings until golden brown. Soak out the grease. Prefered
method is to shake in a brown bag. In a fry pan melt margarine and hot
sauce together.
Dip dried, fried wings in the hot sauce mixture. If you like them
crispy put them on a baking sheet in the oven (350F) for 10 minutes.
The secret for my taste is to get them crispy in the deep frier, then
replace the grease in the crispy skin with hot sauce properly formulated
in its own grease. IMHO no good way to go fat free on this one!

Fry them for 12 - 15 minutes in small enough batches that the oil temp

usually put the "drumettes" in first because they take slightly longer
to cook; then I add the other pieces after the drumettes have cooked for
about 1 minute. They're cooked when the bubbles slow down and the wing
pieces are all floating. Agitate the pieces occasionally during frying
so they don't stick together.
While the wings are frying, put the margarine and sauce in a small
saucepan or skillet and heat it on low. Bring the mixture to a simmer,
stirring occasionally.
When the wings are done, remove them from the oil and drain. Place the
wing pieces in a plastic bowl with a tight fitting lid (I use a
Tupperware container) and pour the hot sauce mixture over the wing

thoroughly coating the wing pieces with sauce.

The Wings:
---------Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 360 degrees F., using vegetable
oil. My outdoor cast iron kettle type deep fryer with 1 gallon of oil
will do 24 wingettes in 8 minutes. 30 in 10 minutes. Hotter oil for 8
minutes = crispier. Hotter oil for 10 minutes = crispier and dry inside.
Your mileage may vary! With the basket and cooking thermometer in the
hot oil, @360 degrees I drop in one wing at a time. If the count stops
at 24 I then set the timer for 8 minutes. Every couple minutes toss the
basket contents to redistribute. The above method of loading the basket
eliminates the wings from sticking to the basket. IMHO.
Drain the wings for a minute then put them in a bowl.

BUFFALO WINGS
=============
This is a wing recipe from a guy who used to cook wings for a living in
Buffalo.
Get some Durkee's Frank's Original Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce, there
is "no" adequate substitute, you may have to ask your grocer to order
it, or call Durkee/French's at 714-526-3363. If it's the little
bottles, get two or three of them, I get the gallon jug from a
restaurant supply place, cheap! It used to be called Frank's Red Hot
Pepper Sauce, then it was Durkee's Louisiana Hot Sauce, but there
already was a brand name Louisiana Hot Sauce. Still tastes the same!
Acquire some margarine.
resistance to burning).

Only margarine works right (correct taste and
Neither oil nor butter will substitute.

Get the wings cut up, and start heating up the frying grease. Some
revisionist (or health-conscious) types insist on other cooking methods,
but there is nothing like the real crisp-on-the-outside moist
-and-chewy-on-the-inside texture of fried wings.
Make up the sauce. Put the Durkee's and margarine into a skillet or
saute pan big enough to comfortably hold one fryer-load of wings. The
total amount of sauce at once should be about a quarter of an inch in
the bottom of the pan.
The proportions are:
Equal parts is the nominal starting point (called "medium" in Buffalo).
A bit of tingle, but not very spicy.
Undiluted Durkee's doesn't taste as good, but is pretty hot.
one, Durkee's to margarine is about as hot as I like it.

Three to

For the really timid (like kids) just a splash of Durkee's in the margarine
gives a little flavor but no noticeable hot. The idea is to cook up the
Durkee's and margarine to a bit thicker consistency. It should simmer for

Buffalo Chicken Wing Recipes : COLLECTION

5 minutes or so, then be kept hot.
You can make up just one batch of sauce for a bunch of wings. You can just
add more ingredients to the pan as you use up the sauce. When you add more
ingredients, you can adjust the spiciness.
I use this to satisfy everybody, I start out with all the margarine I plan
to use, and put in just a splash of Durkee's. That makes a few wings for
the kids. Then a bunch more Durkee's to make the wings medium. Still more
Durkee's to get it the way I like it.
Fry the wings. They're cooked when the bubbles slow down significantly.
This takes seeing it once to know just how much bubbling corresponds to
"done," but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to get it right. At home,
I put the "drumettes" in first, because they take a minute or two longer
to cook. As always with frying, be sure that you don't put in so much
food that the temperature of the fat drops below 325 or so, and have the
heat on so it gets back up to 375 ASAP.
As the wings finish cooking, take them out and drain thoroughly. I
generally put them in a strainer held over the fat. Don't pile them up
in a bowl, or the fat will cool and congeal before it runs off!
Once the wings are drained, put them in the sauce and get the wings covered
with sauce. The official restaurant way to do this is to toss them in the
air, but your stove cleaner may not appreciate this.
Use tongs to pick the wings out of the pan and let the sauce drain off.
Toss the wings on a grill or in a hot oven for a few minutes at this point
to "bake on" the sauce.
Serve with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing on the side. Yes, the
BCD *is* for the wings! But make sure it is good BCD, with nice chunks of
good cheese. (One of the sadder realizations of my growing up is that there
are some things you just can't get, restaurants get a special Kraft dressing
that comes only in five-gallon containers that must be continuously
refrigerated. Great stuff, not available to you and me.)

Well, here is my all-time favourite chicken recipe. The original recipe
says to use chicken wings, but I've always used part-boned chicken
thighs, and it tastes wonderful with them. Also, I've tried the recipe
with and without the skin on the chicken, and either works fine. The
skin's calorific and I'm not too keen on it anyway, so why bother,

to react with metal). Put the chicken pieces into the bowl and make
sure thoroughly coated with the marinade.
Leave to marinate for either 1 1/2 hours in the fridge, or for 45
minutes at room temperature. (I often leave it to marinate for several
hours in the fridge sometimes if my time schedule prefers it, and it
still works out fine).
Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.
Again make sure the chicken pieces are thoroughly coated in the marinade
and put the pieces on a wire rack above a roasting pan (just something
to catch the drips really). Cook for 45 mins, and during that time take
the tray out of the oven a couple of times to baste the chicken pieces
with remaining marinade.
(Can serve with a green salad if you like, or garnished with chopped
spring onions)
Serves: Well for the original recipe with the 8 chicken wings it said
serve 4. Me loving this recipe soooo much, I usually do 2 chicken
thighs/half quantities for my one serving.
Calories: Not bad at all.

2 chicken wings (with skin) as a serving is

MODIFIED BUFFALO WINGS
======================
Ingredients:
-----------2 tbsp
butter (or margarine)
1 bottle Lousiana hot sauce (I think this is an 8 oz bottle I
can't remember exactly)
juice of 1 lime (or two to taste)
celery
blue cheese dressing (the chunky kind works best, I use Maries)
Instructions:
------------Put butter, hot sauce and lime into a sauce pan. Bring to a VERY slow
boil then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. This will
help to reduce the sauce a bit and it will take some of the heat out of
the hot sauce. The lime add a little flavor and gives the sauce some
body. The citrus increases the bite but the lime flavor really enhances
the overall taste. The butter add a little flavor but it isn't enough
to make the wings slip out of your hands.
Lightly flour the wings and deep fry (just make sure that the wings are
crispy and FULLY cooked, no trips to the hospital please!!)
Celery and bleu cheese dressing are a must... Buy extra so that your
guests can nibble as they watch you deep fry the chicken.

1/4 cup

Combine the ingredients.
Instructions for Wings:
----------------------Cut 2-3 lbs of wings into 3 pieces. Discard the wingtips and marinate
the remaining pieces for at least 30 minutes. Agitate the pieces
occasionally while they are marinating.
Cover a cookie pan with foil and, using tongs, place the marinated wing
pieces on it. I suggest using a cookie PAN, as opposed to a sheet,
because the sides will insure that none of the marinade mixture drips
off the edge and screws up your oven. There should be a slight
seperation between each individual piece so they don't stick together.
Cook for one hour at 350 F, turning the wing pieces every 10 minutes.
If you want them to come out nice and even, you need to turn them
individually with a pair of tongs. If you don't turn them, they'll
stick and burn on one side.
After they are done, let stand for at least 20 minutes.

REAL BUFFALO WINGS
==================
Well I'll give the REAL "ORIGNAL" anchor bar recipe for Buffalo Wings.
The anchor bar is the birthplace of Buffalo wings. I'll warn you that
I'm not a great cook and never follow a recipe.
Instructions:
------------1) Mix flour and cyann pepper and toss the mix into a bag.
2) Dump a couple of bottles of tabasco sauce in a plastic bag.
3) Dump some vinegar (the good kind that gets your wife mad when you use
it) into a bowl.
4) Dip the wings in the vinegar.
5) Shake them in the flour mix (you want a light dusting).

6) Toss them in the tabasco (get lots on em).
7) Deep fry until done.
8) Serve with blue cheese dressing (very cold), celery, carrots.
Note:

Buffalo Style Chicken Wings (1)

24 wings
4 cups oil (peanut, corn, or other)
4T butter
2-5T (one 2.5 oz. bottle) Frank's
1T white vinegar
Louisiana Hot Sauce
2-1/2C blue cheese dressing
salt and pepper
celery sticks
Discard small tip of each wing, split at large joint and sprinkle
with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large casserole or fryer (until
quite hot). Add half of wings and cook, stirring occasionally.
When brown and crisp (15-20 min.), remove and drain well. Cook
remaining wings. Melt butter in saucepan and add hot sauce and
vinegar. Put wings on a warm platter and pour sauce over them (or
put wings and sauce in a closed container and shake). Serve with
celery sticks, blue cheese dressing (for dipping), and beer.
The unfortunate part of the referenced recipe is that it is loaded
with fat. For a low(er) fat variation that still tastes good, (got
rave reviews when we served them at our last party) broil the wings
instead of frying them, and then mix 1/2 cup hot sauce, 4 tbs honey,
2 tbs vinegar, 2 tbs lemon juice, 1 heaping tsp dry mustard, like
Coleman's. Heat the sauce until it thickens, and then put the wings
in, and then cook till it thickens even more, while stirring the
wings around. Still taste good with celery sticks and blue cheese
dressing. Might as well go all the way and use lower fat cheese
dressing, though.

Stephanie da Silva's Buffalo Wing Collection

Wings, being mostly chicken skin, have a large amount of fat in
them, no matter what you do. You can help a little by broiling them
so that some of the fat melts away, and not
adding any more. I would recommend grilling the wings. That way,
you lose the fat (a good thing) without losing the flavor (which
would be a bad thing).

BLUE CHEESE DRESSING
1 c. mayonnaise
2 Tbsp. finely chopped onion
1 tsp. finely minced garlic
1/4 c. finely chopped parsley
1/2 c. sour cream
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
1 Tbsp. white vinegar
1/4 c. crumbled blue cheese
salt, pepper, cayenne to taste
Combine and chill for an hour or longer.
Buffalo Wings (2)

2 lb. Chicken Wings
1/4 cup Margarine (not butter)
1/2 cup Durkee's Louisiana Hot Sauce (used to be Frank's)
Heat cooking oil in a deep fryer to 375 F.
Cut each wing into 3 pieces and discard the wingtips.
Do not remove the skin from the wings.
Fry them for 12 - 15 minutes in small enough batches that
the oil temp won't drop below 325 F. My deep fryer will
handle 2 lb at a time. I usually put the "drumettes" in first
because they take slightly longer to cook; then I add the
other pieces after the drumettes have cooked for about
1 minute. They're cooked when the bubbles slow down and
the wing pieces are all floating. Agitate the pieces
occasionally during frying so they don't stick together.
While the wings are frying, put the margarine and sauce in
a small saucepan or skillet and heat it on low. Bring the
mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
When the wings are done, remove them from the oil and drain.
Place the wing pieces in a plastic bowl with a tight fitting
lid (I use a Tupperware container) and pour the hot sauce
mixture over the wing pieces. Put the lid on the plastic
container and shake it well, thoroughly coating the wing
pieces with sauce.

Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 360 degrees F., using vegetable
oil. My outdoor cast iron kettle type deep fryer w/1 gallon of oil
will do 24 wingettes in 8 minutes. 30 in 10 minutes. Hotter oil for 8
minutes= crispier. Hotter oil for 10 minutes = crispier and dry inside.
Your mileage may vary! With the basket and cooking thermometer in the hot
oil, @360 degrees I drop in one wing at a time. If the count stops at 24
I then set the timer for 8 minutes. Every couple minutes toss the basket
contents to redistribute. The above method of loading the basket eliminates
the wings from sticking to the basket. IMHO
Drain the wings for a minute then put them in a bowl.
Pour the sauce over them, cover the bowl, and shake
to completely coat the wings. Watch how they do it at Hooters!
Serve with carrot and celery sticks, Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing, and
cold beer.

Yield: 8 servings
Seasoning Mix (Makes 2 tablespoons plus 1 3/4 teaspoons)

Stephanie da Silva's Buffalo Wing Collection

2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons paprika (mild, or Hungarian hot paprika)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
10 tablespoons (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, in all
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce, in all
24 chicken wings, tips removed, room temperature
2 cups vegetable oil
Blue Cheese Dressing (recipe follows)
Celery sticks (optional)
Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
Melt 5 tablespoons of the butter with 2 teaspoons of the Tabasco sauce in a
small saucepan over low heat. Pour into a small shallow bowl or pie plate,
and let cool slightly.
Put the chicken wings into a large bowl and coat well with 2 tablespoons of
the seasoning mix. Add the butter/Tabasco mixture and work in well with
your hands until chicken is completely coated and seasonings are well
distributed. (Make sure the chicken wings are at room temperature;
otherwise, the seasoning mixture will congeal and you'll have a mess of
gunk that won't stick well to the chicken.) Set aside to marinate (for up
to 30 minutes, covered) and heat the oil.
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat until it is very hot.
Add the chicken wings, fitting in as many as there is room for in a single
layer. Fry until crisp and golden brown, about 8 to 12 minutes, turning
several times. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining wings.
Meanwhile, make a sauce to finish the wings by melting the remaining butter
and adding the remaining Tabasco and seasoning mix. Dip the cooked wings
into the finishing sauce and place on a serving platter. Serve with the
Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks, if desired.
Blue Cheese Dressing
2 eggs
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup chopped onions
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cups vegetable oil
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
Put everything but the oil and blue cheese into a blender or food processor

and process for 15 to 20 seconds. Continue to process, adding the oil
slowly in a thin stream. When oil has been added, process for an additional
45 seconds, or until well thickened. Add the cheese and mix well.

Buffalo Chicken Salad

Marinate a few boneless chicken breasts in Durkee's Red Hot Sauce (I
swear by the stuff at work, I should have known it was the best for
Buffalo Wings - it is great in Crab Dip, too)
and a little olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. I like to let
the chicken sit overnight so that it soaks up the true flavor of the
durkee's. Bake off the chicken at 350 until cooked through, and no
pink shows.
Let cool and tear into pieces, drizzling more Durkee's
if the flavor is not enough. Then I just toss it with chopped celery,
and homemade blue cheese dressing. The dressing certainly does not
have a recipes (We really don't use recipes in catering)- basically it
is Mayo, Sour Cream, Chopped Green onion, salt, pepper, lemon juice,
and crumbled blue cheese - Saga Blue usually. The secret is to let
the blue cheese set in the fridge at least overnight.

BEGGAR'S CHICKEN
================
Back in the old day's the Oriental people used to wrap the chook in
lotus leaves, then in clay, then throw it into a hot fire to cook. Be
sure to have a hammer ready so you can eat the sucker!!!
Ingredients:
-----------1.5kg
(3lb) chook
3
shallots

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/meat/chicken/chick-coll-1.html (3 of 33) [12/17/1999 11:20:02 AM]

COLLECTION: Chicken Recipes Vol.1 (of 3)

2.5cm
(1") piece green ginger (the fresh stuff)
1 tsp
sugar
3 tblsp soy sauce
2 tblsp dry sherry
1 tblsp water
1/4 tsp five spice powder
2 tblsp soy sauce, extra
2 tblsp oil
extra oil
Clay Dough:
----------1kg (2lbs) cooking salt
4 cups
plain flour
1 1/2 cups water (more or less)
Put flour and salt in a bowl, mix well, gradually add water, mixing to a
firm dough. Use your hands to mix. More water may be needed, don't
have dough too soft, it will be too hard to handle.
Place two very large sheets of aluminium foil on a flat surface, brush
top sheet well with extra oil. Wack the chook onto the foil. In a bowl
put roughly chopped shallots, sugar, peeled and sliced ginger, soy
sauce, sherry, water and five spice powder; mix well. Rub the chook all
over with extra soy sauce, then rub with the 2 tablesps of oil, rub well
into the skin. Pull skin at neck end down under the chook and tuck the
wing tips under as well to hold the neck skin in place. Carefully (the
chook will feel like a greased pig at this stage!!) pour soy sauce
mixture into the cavity, (hold the chook up a bit so none runs out).
Secure the bum end with a small skewer (be careful it doesn't rip the
foil). Wrap the foil around the chook, securing like a parcel.
Roll out the dough to about 1cm (1/2") thickness so it will completely
cover the chook, fold dough over the bird, press edges together, press
ends together so the chook is completely encased with no holes anywhere.
Place chook into lightly oiled baking dish, wet your fingers and smooth
out all joins, making sure there are no holes in the dough (the steam
will get out otherwise)
Bake in a hot (475-550F / 250-260C) oven for 1 hour. Reduce heat to
moderately slow (325-350F / 160-180C) for a further 3 hours. Remove the
end result from the oven (you don't have to worry about dropping it!!!),
break open the dough with the hammmer and remove from around the chook.
Put foil wrapped chook onto a serving dish, carefully remove foil and
hook in. The meat will just fall off the bones so chop-stick will
probably be in order.
Trust me, this is fantastic (especially when your friends see you carry a

BOB'S CHICKEN PESTO
===================
Ingredients:
-----------1 lb. boneless chicken, cubed
1 lb. box multi-colored pasta
3 red peppers
2 tomatoes
3 cloves garlic
broccoli (or vegs of your choosing)
olive oil
pesto
fresh curly parsley
salt and pepper
parmesan cheese (optional)
Instructions:
------------Start water for pasta. In skillet, brown garlic over a low heat in a
generous amount of olive oil. Add chicken - cook over medium heat.
When done, set aside covered to keep hot.
While chicken is cooking, cut red peppers into large strips. Put
peppers under broiler; burn skin on each side. Then, remove from
broiler and put peppers into a small sealed plastic (i.e. ziploc) or
paper bag (to steam themselves). Set aside ~10 minutes; after which,
remove skins, cut into cubes and toss with olive oil.
While peppers are steaming in bag:
- Put pasta into boiling water - add salt to taste.
- Steam vegs (don't overcook, they should remain a bit crunchy).
- Cut up tomatoes into cubes.
When pasta is done, rinse under very hot water (don't want it to cool
off). Add chicken with its oil, mix together. Then mix in vegs, cubed
roasted peppers and tomatoes. Next add pesto, herbs and pepper to
taste, mix. Optional: toss with parmesan cheese.
Serve with warm Italian bread.

BSTILA - MOROCCAN CHICKEN/NUT PIE
==================================
Ingredients:
-----------meat of 1/2 chicken (e.g. two boneless breasts)
1/2 lb blanched almonds
1 medium onion
1/2 tsp cinnamon
up to 1/2c sugar or honey
1 tbsp clarified butter
1/3 cup butter
Preparation:
-----------Brown 1/2 lb blanched almonds in a little oil until golden. Chop
coarsely or pound with a mortar and pestle. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and
(optionally) honey or sugar to sweeten to taste (anc adds none but cites
recipes calling for up to 1/2c sugar -- I favor a little honey as the
contrast of the sweetness with the savory chicken is part of the exotic
appeal of the dish). Set aside.
Heat 1 tbsp clarified butter and 1/3 cup butter in a large heavy pot.
Add 1 minced medium onion and saute for a few minutes. Add chicken meat
equivalent to about 1/2 chicken (e.g. two boneless breasts), cut in
small pieces (as for a pot pie), along with:
1/2 tsp
pepper
1 pinch
saffron (or, per ongoing thread, 1/2 tsp turmeric)

Have ready phillo sheets, melted butter (at least 1/4 lb), and a pastry
brush. Select a shallow baking pan about 8" in diameter, such as an
iron skillet. What you basically want to do is construct a pie by
layering the phillo sheets in the pan and then folding them over the
contents; it will probably be easiest if you cut the sheets in half or
smaller, for instance into long rectangles about the width of the pan
and twice as long. Brush one of the sheets with melted butter, and put
it, butter side up, in the bottom of the pan, the excess dangling over
the side. Add another sheet, at an angle to the first, and repeat so
that you have phillo covering the bottom of the pan and dangling out all
around (this is hard to describe). Use about 5 sheets to form this
layer. Repeat the process, forming another layer. Now pour the chicken

and sauce into the pan. Put several more buttered sheets on top of the
chicken, this time not overlapping the edge--use smaller pieces or fold
them in half. Spread the nut mixture on top of this. Put another layer
or so of phillo, then fold the dangling ends over the top so as to close
the envelope. (Your mileage may vary on the number and details of
layering the sheets). Brush the top with butter. At this point the
bstila can be refrigerated if desired (this is time-consuming and you
may wish to do all this the day before serving).
Just before serving, put the pan in a 350-degree oven for 15-20 minutes
until the top is golden: flip it onto an oven-proof plate (or use an
ordinary plate to flip it over back into the skillet) and return to
brown the other side, 30-40 minutes total. Place on a serving platter,
sprinkle with powdered sugar, then make fanciful decorative designs with
ground cinnamon. (When I had this in a restaurant it said something
like "eat me").

Sprinkle the chicken

2. Heat the butter in a skillet and add the chicken pieces, skin side
down. Brown about 5 minutes and turn.
3. Scatter the onion and garlic between the chicken pieces and add the
mushrooms and bay leaf. Cook about 5 minutes.
4. Add the wine and cook until it is almost all evaporated. Add the
rice and broth, taking care that the rice does not rest on top of the
chicken pieces. Cover closely and cook about 20 minutes or until rice
is tender.
Yield: Four servings
Note:
----I cook the whole thing in my favorite cast-iron skillet, which has a
lid. You don't really have to worry about undercooking the chicken, so
the dish is done when the rice tastes done. Sometimes I use shallots
instead of onions if I have them, and mabye add a little (fresh)
tarragon or something. Beats frozen pizza.

Mix flour and salt together well. Cut in butter. Add water and beaten
eggs, and mix until dough forms a ball. Divide dough if necessary and
roll out on a well floured board. This should be rolled out *very*
thin, ~1-1.5 mm thick. Cut the dough into 2-3 inch square pieces and
set aside for the moment. Make sure the dough is not overlapping when
you set it aside...it CANNOT be stacked.
In the meantime (at the beginning) prepare the chicken broth and season
to taste. When all the dumplings are cut, quickly drop them one by one
into the boiling broth. Allow to cook for 1/2 an hour. If the
dumplings are too thick, they will come out tough. It's better to err
on the thin side when rolling them out. This dish can be served with
fried chicken, or with the chicken chopped up in the broth. Makes ~8-10
servings.

1/2 pkg
Hilshire Farms Polish Kielbasa (or other smoked sausage), sliced
1/2

5 stalks
celery, chopped
3
large white onions, chopped (DO NOT use a food processor)
2 cloves
garlic, chopped fine
1/4 cup
peanut oil
2 cups

12oz beer (Budweiser works fine)
flour to coat chicken
1 1/2 tsp Rosemary
1 tsp
Thyme
A handful of chopped parsley (hard to put too much)
Salt to taste
Lots of cayenne pepper
Instructions:
------------Start off by washing the chicken and placing it skin side down on a
plate (you can remove the skin if you want). Now, depending on how
spicy you want it, coat the chicken with Cayenne pepper until very red
(I use a LOT of Cayenne in mine). Don't worry about getting it too hot,
since this is the majority of the pepper you are going to add and it
will cook into the rest of the dish. Turn the chicken pieces over and
lightly coat the skin side. Let sit for 15 minutes or so to soak it all
up.

Heat the oil in the bottom of a large heavy cast iron or aluminum pot
(don't use thin aluminum or stainless steel since the rice will tend to
stick and burn if you're not really careful). Place the flour in a
paper bag (season the flour lightly with salt, cayenne pepper, black
pepper, garlic powder, etc). Place a couple of pieces of chicken at a
time into the bag and shake to coat.
Fry the chicken in the oil until golden brown. Don't worry about
cooking it all the way through just yet. Remove the chicken. Now place
the onions, celery, garlic and bellpepper into the pot along with a bit
more oil if necessary) and saute them until the onions are transparent,
scraping the bottom of the pot often. Add the rosemary, thyme and
parsley and cook for a minute or so.
Place the sausage slices, chicken, and a little water into the pot and
mix well with the vegetables. Turn heat low, cover and simmer for about
30 minutes (until the chicken is tender). Stir the mixture frequently,
always scraping the bottom to keep things from burning (break the
chicken up a bit with the spatula as it cooks. It should break up
naturally as the dish cooks, but this just helps things a little).
When the chicken is cooked, add the washed rice and stir it into
everything for a couple of minutes. Pour the warm beer and the water in
and stir things for another minute or so. Taste it at this point and
adjust the salt if necessary. Now, keeping the heat low, cover the pot
and cook until the rice is tender (anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour).
Stir the mixture every now and then, scraping the bottom of the pot.

CHICKEN BIG MAMOU ON PASTA
==========================
(Makes 6 servings)
The town of Mamou, in southeastern Louisiana, claims itself as the
"tomato capitol of the world." So dishes with the term "Mamou" usually
mean that there are tomatoes in the dish. Calling the dish "... Little
Mamou" means just a few tomatoes; "... Big Mamou" means lots of
tomatoes. So here is a pasta dish that is Cajun in inspiration.
Ingredients:
-----------6 quarts

hot water

vegetable oil
salt
fresh spaghetti, or 1 pound dry
unsalted butter
unsalted butter
very finely chopped onions
garlic, medium-size, peeled
minced garlic
rich chicken stock (in all)
worcestershire sauce
Tabasco sauce
16-ounce cans tomato sauce
sugar
very finely chopped green onions (in all)
boneless chicken (light and dark meat), cut into 1/2" cubes

Seasoning mix no. 1 (for sauce, see below)
Seasoning mix no. 2 (for chicken, see below)
Directions:
----------Place the hot water, oil and salt in a large pot over high heat; cover
and bring to a boil. When water reaches a rolling boil, add small
amounts of spaghetti at a time to the pot, breaking up oil patches as
you drop spaghetti in. Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage
(about 4 minutes if fresh, 7 minutes if dry); do not over cook. During
this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon to lift spaghetti out
of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands back into the boiling water.
(It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to enhance the
spaghetti's texture.)
Then immediately drain spaghetti into a colander; stop cooking process
by running cold water over strands. (If you used dry spaghetti, first
rinse with hot water to wash off starch.) After the pasta has cooled
thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil
in your hands and toss spaghetti. Set aside still in the colander.
Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small
bowl and set aside.
In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1 1/2 sticks of the butter, the onions
and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add the minced garlic and the seasoning mix no. 1;
continue cooking over medium heat until onions are dark brown but not
burned [not unlike you cook onions for Indian curry dishes], about 8 to
10 minutes, stirring often. Add 2 1/2 cups of the stock, the
worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook, about 8
minutes, stirring often. Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture to
a boil. Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions; gently
simmer uncovered about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

oven.

Combine the ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix no. 2 in a small
bowl; mix well. Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your
hands. In a large skillet melt 1 1/2 sticks of the butter over medium
heat. Add the remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat
about 3 minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking 10 minutes,
stirring frequently. When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40
minutes, stir in the chicken mixture and heat through.
To finish the dish, FOR EACH SERVING melt 2 Tbsp butter in a large
skillet over medium heat. Add one-sixth of the cooked spaghetti (a bit
less than a 2-cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute, stirring
constantly. Add 1 1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2 Tbsp of remaining
stock; heat thoroughly, stirring frequently. Remove from heat. Roll
spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a heated serving platter.
Repeat process for remaining servings.

1 tsp
salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
3/4 tsp dried tarragon

Instructions:
------------Depending on how fancy you want to be, the chicken can be breasts cut to
bite size pieces, leftover chicken, whole thighs, etc. Remove any skin
if fresh chicken is used.
Toss the chicken meat with the flour to coat. Shake off any excess
flour and then saute the chicken over medium heat in the olive oil until
nicely browned. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.
Add the onion, garlic and mushroom caps and saute until the onion is
translucent.
Add the tomato paste and continue to cook until the paste starts to get
browned a little.
Deglaze with the wine, stirring well to dilute the tomato paste.
Add the canned tomatoes, the spices and seasonings and the cooked
chicken. Cover, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or longer, adding
chicken stock if necessary to keep from drying out.
Serve with boiled pasta.

1(2) tbs milk
bread crumbs - I often use commercial, season Italian
flour
butter - cold and cut into pieces about the size and
shape of your little finger.
Instructions:
------------Preparation procedure for each breast:
-------------------------------------Between two 1 gal. heavy-duty freezer bags pound breast until quite
thin with a abalone mallet or other flat, heavy object. Careful, do not
break holes in the middle of the chicken. Work slow and carefully!
When flattened, sprinkle with salt, pepper and about a tblsp of
scallions. Place scallions near the center of the breast.
Place a finger of the butter in the middle of the breast and CAREFULLY
fold the chicken over the butter and roll up. Keep in mind that you are
trying to create a watertight package for the butter. Variant: Place
butter at one end of breast and roll-up breast over the butter, folding
the ends in during the process. Like a butcher wrapping meat.
Coat the breast in the flour, dip in the egg mix and finally coat with
bread crumbs. This is part of the sealing process so make sure all the
little nooks and crannies are covered.
Final cooking:
-------------Dependent upon size of deep fryer place 2 to 3 breasts in hot oil and
cook until slightly darker than a brown paper shopping bag. Remove from
fryer and cook for about 15 minutes in a 350 oven.

Cover and let cook on gentile fire till chicken is done.
Notes:
-----1) Cooking is about a half hour to 45 minutes, depending on size of
chicken pieces and level of heat.
2) All of the curd (we used plain yoghurt) curdled (no pun, I think this
is how you would describe it). So, we made another batch of sauce,
using all of the ingredients except the chicken.
3) This was not hot, just spicy enough. You could probably spice it up
with more chilli powder and more garlic, or fresh garlic instead of
powdered.

CHICKEN PAPRIKA
===============
Ingredients:
-----------4 lbs
chicken pieces
1
large onion finely chopped
2 to 3 tblsp sweet hungarian paprika
4 tblsp
butter or margarine
salt and pepper to taste
sour cream (the new fat free type works well too)
flour
Instructions:
------------Melt butter in large fry pan (I use a 4 qt. chicken fryer with a vent
in the lid) and saute onion for a few minutes. Season chicken with salt
and pepper and cook over medium high heat until just golden on both
sides. Sprinkle paprika evenly over chicken. Add enough water to the
pan to come about 1/2 way up the sides of the chicken pieces. Bring to
a boil then cover and turn down to simmer. Leave lid slightly open or
open the lid vent about half way. Simmer for about 2 hours (less if you
use boneless chicken breast).
After the chicken is cooked remove to a platter and cool enough to
handle without burning yourself. Meanwhile strain the juices and return
to the pan. In a medium bowl have about 1/3 cup flour (you may need to
add a little more). Whisk about half of the pan juices into the flour
gradually until mixture is thick and smooth. Return to the remaining
juices in the pan. Turn heat back up to medium and whisk this mixture
until it is very thick and smooth (this is where you may need a little
extra flour). In the same bowl stir about 1/2 cup (more if you like)
sour cream until smooth. Whisk about 1/3 of the gravy into the sour
cream gradually. Return this to the pan and reduce heat to avoid
boiling. By time all of this is done the chicken should be cool enough
to handle. Remove chicken from the bones and cut or tear into bite size
pieces. Return to the pan with the gravy and simmer until heated
through. Adjust seasoning to taste. If there are leftovers this
freezes reasonably well and is even better the next time around.

-----------1
chicken
1/2 teaspoon
turmeric
a tablespoon
of mixed herbs or "bouquet garni"
3
large onions, peeled and minced
3 tablespoons
oil
1/2 cup
butter, margarine or diet margarine, clarified

2 cups
ground toasted almonds
1 tablespoon
cinnamon
12
filo dough sheets
1/4 cup
powdered sugar.
salt, fresh black pepper
pinch of saffron
Preparation:
-----------Place chicken in a roasting pan. If you use saffron threads, let them
soak in half a cup of water. Pour on fowl. Sprinkle salt, pepper,
turmeric and mixed herbs on top. Roast chicken in oven at 400 f for 45
minutes to an hour. Cool. Remove skin and all bones. Cube chicken.
Keep giblets, except for the neck, with all the spicy, herbed juice.

salt and chopped cilantro. Place in another small bowl. Still in the
same oiled skillet, toast almonds until slightly brown and grind them in
a food processor. Set aside.
Clarify the shortening, and everything is ready to be put together now.
On the bottom of the pan used to roast the chicken, after washing and
greasing it, stack 2 sheets of filo dough, letting edges overhang.
Brush on top some of the clarified shortening. At broil, rapidly brown
these 2 sheets. Then add cubed chicken, with all spices and juice.
Spread again 2 more dough sheets with some shortening brushed on.
Broil rapidly. Add soft mixture of eggs with cilantro. Cover with 2
more greased sheets. Broil rapidly. Add almonds mixed with cinnamon
and sugar. Finish with your best-looking greased sheets. Tuck in all
dough and bake 25 to 30 minutes at 400 F until golden grown. Cool
slightly. Sprinkle with remaining powdered sugar, making a decorative
crisscross with cinnamon on top. Serve hot. It can be reheated several
times. It can also be frozen.

CHICKEN RAVIOLI IN PORT MUSTARD CREME SAUCE WITH MANGO GINGER CHUTNEY
=====================================================================
(serves 4 as a pasta dish before the main meal.)
Pasta
----1 cup
1
1 tbl
1 tbl

flour
egg
water
olive oil (gives gummy texture)

Prepare two sheets of pasta rolled out to "6" on the Atlas machine.
You can knead by hand forever or use a food processor on the dough.
Egg wash
-------1
egg
2 tbl
water
Whisk together and brush on one side of each piece of pasta. The egg
wash acts as a glue to hold the ravioli together during cooking.
Filling
------6 oz.
1/6 cup
1/4 cup

cooked chicken (Chef Johnson called for smoked)
cream
mango ginger chutney (buy from your grocery store!)

Combine in food processor, or chop chicken finely with knife and mix
together. (Chef Johnson called for some cayenne and more chutney, but I
cut it down to my taste because I thought it was too spicy.)
Preparation:
-----------Prepare ravioli by putting 1-1 1/2 tsp lumps of chicken filling on one
piece of pasta in a 2xN matrix where N is ~10-12. Place other piece of
pasta over this. Egg side of both sheets should be toward the inside.
Cut ravioli with a knife or a ravioli wheel. Seal ravioli with fingers
or by pressing with a fork. Flour well and set aside.
You should make 20-24 ravioli. You will need 16 to serve. Expect a few
to fall apart while cooking.
When sauce is ready, cook ravioli until they rise.

Sauce
----1 cup
8
1
2

port wine
peppercorns, bruised or cracked
bay leaf
shallots, diced

Reduce over high heat until nearly dry.
1 cup chicken stock
Add and reduce until total volume is about 1/4 cup.
1 cup cream
1 tbl mustard
Add, whisk, and reduce until sauce naps. (Napping means: dip a
spoon in the sauce, wipe the back horizontally with your finger.
If the sauce does not run it is thick enough.)
Strain the sauce and keep warm. (Strained sauces come from
French tradition. You want a smooth pretty sauce with no chunks
of pepper and lumps of shallots.)
I adjusted the proportions in this recipe from Chef Johnson's
original. I used less cream and more port because I like the
greater flavor and color from the port.
Prepare four individual plates. On each plate, pour an equal portion of
the sauce. Makes sure the sauce coats the entire center of the plate but
none of the side. Place four cooked ravioli on the place, and scoop
about 2 tbl of the chutney on the middle of the plate. It should look very
pretty.
What sort of wine would go with this course? I've had it with a
Chardonnay and with a German Riesling. In both cases, the ginger, etc.,
overpowered the wine. Perhaps an Alsatian Gewurztraminer would do
better, or perhaps this course just isn't suited to wine. :-(

COLLECTION: Chicken Recipes Vol.2 (of 3)

Ingredients:
-----------Couple of chicken breasts
1 or 2 white onions
bunch of scallions (green onions, about 12)
sugar
black pepper
soy sauce
garlic powder
onion powder
chicken broth (boullion cube in a coup of water will do).
Directions:
----------Put about 1/2 to 1 cup of peanut oil in wok, and put on stove on highest
heat -- keep the heat on HIGH the entire time you cook in the wok. Add
the chicken when the oil is hot and cook until tender and no longer
pink. While cooking, sprinkle garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper
on chicken. Add about 2 tablespoons of sugar over chicken for sweet
taste. More or less is fine. When the chicken is done browning, add
the chicken broth and vegetables. Cook for about 3 or 4 more minutes,
until broth starts to steam. Squirt soy sauce over the whole thing,
probably about 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Add some cold water with corn starch to
thicken the sauce, how much is up to you, I usually use about 3
tablespoons in 1/3 cup or so. Stir it all together to coat everything
evenly and serve over a bed of rice. Serve HOT.
Note:
----The more
of a cup
granuals
brownish

sugar you add, the sweeter it will taste. I've used up to 1/2
in the past. You basically want to coat the chicken with sugar
when adding the sugar...This makes a nice sweet sauce, sort of
in color (from the soy sauce)...

pinch
1/4 tsp
1 tsp
a little

of salt
sugar (or MSG)
corn flour
gound white pepper-optional

Method:
------Mix all the above ingredients in 1/4 cup water till well blended. Add
in to cooked chicken, vegetables, etc, and stir mixture over the heat
until gravy (sauce) thickens.
Hints:
-----Marinate and stir fry the chicken, by itself, first. Brown some garlic
and/or ginger(according to your recipe), then stir-fry the vegetables.
When vegetables are 3/4 cooked, add in the stir-fried chicken, basic
sauce, and stir-fry till the sauce thickens and is no longer 'cloudy'
looking. Always remember to vary the sauce ingredients according to
taste, and if sauce becomes too thick, add in a little more water, and
if it thicken enough, add more cornflour blended into a little room
temperature water, first.(if the sauce is not thick enough)

CHINESE-JEWISH CHICKEN
======================
Ingredients:
-----------1 roasting chicken
Master sauce
Instructions:
------------In large pot, cover chicken 3/4 to all the way with sauce. Boil chicken
for 20 to 30 minutes, turning the chicken over halfway through the time.
Chicken then is removed from pot -- it will be golden color. Place
chicken, breast down, on roaster in preheated very hot oven, 475-500F.
Roast until done, turning chicken to breast side up halfway through.
Cooking time will vary with weight of chicken. Total cooking time is
around an hour for a 2-3 lb roaster. Chicken is done when juices run
clear.
Chicken will have very crisp skin, and will be very moist inside, from
the two cooking modes. Sometimes, in the summer when I don't want the
oven heat, I put the chicken, cut into two split halves, on the grill
instead of the oven. Carve as a roast chicken, and use plum sauce as a
dip.
(We usually serve this chicken with rice and stir fried broccoli.)

Instructions:
------------Rub fillets in with pepper and salt and sojasauce. Dip first in beaten
egg and then in chipped coconut, so that they get entirely covered.
Put them in a frying pan with some not too hot butter: be careful that
the fillets don't stick to the pan and that the coconut does not get too
dark. They will be done in about ten minutes. Check to be sure.
Then take them out and keep them warm. Turn up the heat and put in the
same frying pan pineapple slices along with the juice from the tin.
Keep the slices moving and brown them in about a minute or two.
Serve the pineapple and the juice with the chicken.
Goes well with rice and a salad.

COLD CHICKEN RECIPE
===================
I don't have the exact proportions with me but an excellent dish in the
summer is cold poached chicken with tuna basil sauce. Poach (or even
grill) the chicken breasts in the morning and chill them for at least
six hours.
The night before combine reasonable proportions of canned tuna fish(one
can), yogurt (just a touch), about 1/3 of a cup of basil, juice from
half a lemon and three or four anchovies. Mix it all in the blender and
achieve a decent consistancy by adjusting the ingredients. To serve put
a dollop of the sauce on the chicken, sprinkle with paprika and garnish
with a basil leaf. Excellent and easy. (Sorry about not having the
complete recipe.)

garlic and pepper with the ginger and a liberal amount of curry powder.

eggplant and asparagus until eggplant is tender being careful not to
burn onion etc.

let simmer for about 5 min until hot. Then take a little of the juice
out and mix with sour cream. Put mixture back in and add hen. Cover
and simmer for about 30 to 40 min until juices run clear when you

DIJON CHICKEN
=============
Mix about a cup of flour with some black pepper, thyme, and marjoram.
About a tsp of each.
Dredge boneless chicken breasts in the flour and then brown in butter in
a skillet.

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/meat/chicken/chick-coll-2.html (31 of 32) [12/17/1999 11:20:21 AM]

COLLECTION: Chicken Recipes Vol.2 (of 3)

Remove the chicken, add about a 1/4 cup of vermouth and cook down to a
glaze. Add a couple tablespoons of dijon mustard (I like LOTS), stir,
add about a half cup of heavy cream, and simmer.
Add approx 1/4 cup of chicken broth, mixed with some of the leftover
flour mixture and pour in the sauce to thicken. Add a tablespoon or so
of lemon juice. Add the chicken breasts and simmer until hot.
Delicious.
Variations:
----------1) Cut up the chicken breasts into small strips before dredging in the
flour. It really tastes better this way, I think.
2) Add sliced fresh mushrooms to the sauce, letting them cook up a bit
with the sauce.
3) Add artichoke hearts to the sauce, just before adding back the
chicken.

GARLIC-GINGER ROASTED CHICKEN
=============================
Here is a good thing to do with a whole chicken:
1. prepare a marinade using soy sauce (1/2 cup), honey (1/4 cup),
vinegar (any kind, 1/4 cup), chopped garlic (2 tbsp or so), and minced
ginger root (2 tbsp or so). The proportions are a matter of taste.
2. Place your rinsed chicken in a ziplock bag and cover with marinade.
Seal to exclude air so chicken is fully contacted by the marinade. Let
marinate at least 8 hours or overnight for a more intense flavor.
3. When ready to roast, place breat side down in a shallow pan. Roast
about 20 - 25 minutes per pound, 350 F. Baste with the marinade or pan
juices every 15 minutes. Turn the chicken breast side up during the
last half hour. Chicken should be a nice mahogany color when done.
Keep a close eye on it though; the marinade can scorch a little with all
that honey in it.

or a day-old cube of bread browns in just under a minute. Heat for
another 4 mins. Put the chicken pieces in the oil, then stir fry for 3
mins.
Remove the chicken, and keep warm in the paper-lined dish in the oven.
Empty the oil from the wok, reduce the heat to medium (350deg) and stir

GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN (2)
=========================
Quoting from the article the recipe was contained in, "The dish is not
difficult to make and can be prepared partially in advance. The crunch
texture of the chicken pieces is achieved by coating them with egg and
cornstarch, then deep-frying them twice - once to cook them through and
once at a higher temperature to make them brown and crisp. The velvety
sweet-sour sauce, which is combined with the chicken at the last minute,
provides a wonderful counterpoint. The amount of heat is your option.
Sixteen small dried red peppers provide a moderate amount of heat. Add
more or less to taste, but be careful not to bite into one. They are
dynamite!"
Ingredients:
-----------1
egg
1 tblsp
cornstarch
1 lb
boned, skinned chicken cut from thigh or breast
into 2 inch chuncks
About 16 small dried hot red chili peppers
4 to 5
green onions, cut diagonally into 1" pieces
1 clove
garlic, finely minced
1/4 tsp
grated fresh gingerroot

The Meat:
I've used pork fillets and chicken but my favourite is lamb. I use the
cut called *fillets* which is like the beef fillet or tenderloin only
much smaller. But you can use forequarter or leg or lamb - or chicken
or whatever you will.

1 tsp

3 cloves
1/2 tsp

sambal oelek (red pepper concentrate)

Barbecue or grill the meat. Meanwhile take around half a cup of smooth
or crunchy peanut butter, put it in a saucepan, and gradually mix in the
marinade (strained, if you wish). Place over a gently heat and stir
while it heats through. If it doesn't look like enough, add more peanut
butter and more water - this stuff is ADDICTIVE so make plenty. You
might want to chuck in some more sambal oelek if you like your food
fiery. You can actually add quite a bit of water and still get a fair
amount of sauce from the peanut butter. It just seems to thicken up as
you go. But compensate by adding more soy (for the saltiness and
flavour) and more garlic and spicesas you see fit.
We have this dish with either plain rice or nasi goreng (fried rice).
We like to have side dishes of sliced gherkins, tomato quarters, and
bananas sliced and sprinkled with lemon juice.
If you don't feel up to grilling and saucemaking simultaneously, make
the sauce first and reheat it in the microwave when you need it. Add
sugar to it if you like a sweeter sate sauce. Use coconut milk instead
of water if you wish. Selamat makan!!!

2 tsp
salt

allspice (BTW, In Jamaica, allspice is called "pimento")
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp cinammon
4 to 6
hot peppers, finely ground (Habernero ideal, otherwise Jalepeno)
1 tsp

JERK CHICKEN
============
Instructions:
------------6 to 8
green onions, diced
1
medium-sized onion, diced
2 to 4
scotch bonnet peppers or jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
3/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tblsp fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp
whole cloves, crushed
1 tsp
black peppercorns, crushed
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
Instructions:
------------Place all ingredients except chicken in a food processor fitted with a
metal blade. Process for 10 to 15 seconds at high speed. Place the
chicken in a bowl and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate for 4 to 6
hours.
Preheat grill until coals are gray to white.
Remove the chicken from the marinade and drain off any excess liquid.
Place on the oiled grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or
until the chicken is white in the center. Serve the chicken with fried
plantains, pumpkin rice with kale, and steamed okra.
Alternative:
-----------Jerk chicken can also be baked in the oven. Pour the jerk marinade over
chicken pieces (4 drum, 4 thigh) and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours,
turning after 3 hours. Remove the chicken pieces and place on a baking
sheet. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until meat pulls easily
away from the bone. Bake 30 to 40 minutes if using chicken breast
strips.

KUNG PAO CHICKEN #1
===================
Ingredients:
-----------1+ lb. chicken breasts. Since I usually don't decide what to have for
dinner until I get home, the chicken's usually frozen and I "nuke" it
until it's still fairly hard; then it's easy to cut into ~1/2" cubes.
Add 1+ Tbl corn starch and an egg white, mix it up and set aside.
A bunch (or more) green onions. Just pull off the dry or mushy parts
and rinse, but you can use pretty much the whole things. Cut 'em in 1/2
to 1 inch pieces. Add 1 or 2 crushed garlic cloves (or, if you're me,
4-6!)
3/4 cup peanuts (or more, or less).
Sauce: (I don't actually measure any of this)
---------------------------------------------http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/meat/chicken/chick-coll-3.html (14 of 36) [12/17/1999 11:20:31 AM]

COLLECTION: Chicken Recipes Vol.3 (of 3)

1+ tsp. chili paste w/ garlic
1 tsp. sesame oil
1 tsp. red wine vinegar or rice vinegar
1 tsp. sugar
1+ tsp. corn starch
1/4 cup chicken stock (I'm lazy: bouilon and water works fine)
1++ Tbl cooking sherry (white wine does the trick)
1 oz. soy sauce (I prefer the darker, but it doesn't matter)
5-10 dried red peppers (the ~1-2" long ones)
Instructions:
------------Get 1+ cup of oil (I use corn oil) REALLY hot in a wok. Within reason,
the hotter the oil, the more quickly the chicken will cook and the less
grease it will soak up. Cook the chicken until it's almost done, and
the pieces have stopped sticking to each other. Remove.
In the same oil, cook the peanuts. If you overcook them, they're pretty
bad. You'll find that you'll get a strong peanut odor (aroma?) in the
kitchen when they're ready to come out. Remove.
Dump all
peppers,
and cook
seconds.
turn off

but ~2 Tbl oil somewhere, and heat it to smoking. Add the
and cook until black (not very long!). Add the green onions
(stir fry) ~30 seconds. Add the chicken and stir fry ~60
Add the sauce, and when the sauce begins to thicken, you can
the stove. Stir in the peanuts.

After you've made this a couple times, and all the ingredients have
found their way into the same cabinet, you'll find that you can prepare
this using VERY few utensils and fairly quickly. I can have it on the
table, including "nuking" the meat, in under 30 minutes.
One final word of caution: if you want to double the recipe, cook the
meat in batches. If you try to cook more than ~1-1/3 lbs. of meat at
one time, it'll just sit in the wok and soak up grease.

chili powder
1tsp
crushed garlic
1tsp
crushed ginger
1.5tsp black cumin seeds
1.5tsp coriander
1tsp
salt
2tsp
garam masala
3
or so green chilis
fresh coriander
Instructions:
------------Mix the spices and yoghurt up in a bucket and throw in the chicken parts
and puree. Leave this to one side. In a thick bottomed pot, melt the
butter and fry the onions until they are sort of translucent. Pump up
the heat, throw the yoghurt/puree/spice/chicken mix into the seething
oil and stir fry, stirring continuously in big loops, for 5 minutes or
more. Turn down the heat to about simmering temperature and add about
0.25 - 0.3 pint water. Let this simmer/cook for about 30 minutes or
until you have started biting the table with the wonderful smell coming
from the pot. Chop up the green chilis and coriander, and dunk them in.
Cook for a further 10 mins, then serve with basmati rice, naan and some
sort of daal.
Mind you, eating this meal every day will lead to a swift cholestrol
death, but the flavour is superb. I have found when serving this to
other people that aren't used to spicy food, cutting down on the chili
and cumin seeds helps a lot.

1.5 tsp
1/2 tsp
1 Tbsp
2/3 cup

instant chicken bouillon granule (yuck! try spice mix)
finely grated orange peel
cornstarch dissolved in 1 Tbsp. cold water
seedless grapes, halved

Instructions:
------------1. Preheat to 350 deg. Arrange chicken skin up in 13x9x2" baking pan.
Season w/salt, pepper, and 1/4 tsp. paprika.
2. In bowl, mix o.j., scallion, bouillon granules (or spice mix) and
peel. Pour over chicken, and bake 1 hr., until chicken is brown and
tender.
3. In medium saucepan, mix dissolved cornstarch and remaining paprika.
Stir in 3/4 cup of pan drippings; bring to a boil. Stir constantly
until thick and bubbly. Add grapes and cook for 2 min., until hot.
Footnotes:
---------If you poor the juices from cooked chicken into a container, then
refrigerate, waxy fats will congeal at the top, easy to scrape off of
the high protein gelatin underneath, then later, you need only heat up
the gelatin to have homemade broth or soup base! Can be stored in
freezer in old yogurt/sherbert containers for a long time.
Bouillon granules are frequently high in salt and MSG, among other
nasties. Instead try salt-free spice mixes, such as Parsley Patch (R)
or Mrs. Dash (R), or add a little more scallions and peels.
Other orange-chicken recipes may ask for 1/8-1/4 tsp. ground cloves
(yum!), 1 Tbsp. honey, 1/4(+)tsp. cinnamon, and/or fresh or frozen
berries (cran, ras, black, etc.). Try mixing and matching to get your
own favorite blend.
To add "orange" to chicken *breasts*, melt (<) 2 Tbsp. butter in frying
pan over med heat, add seasoned chicken for 8-10 minutes, turning once.
Then continue with sauces as described above...

COLLECTION: Chicken Recipes Vol.3 (of 3)

Serves 6.
Variation:
---------This is even better that the original. Substitute wild rice for all or
part of the rice. You will have to check to see how much raw wild rice
you will need to yield the same amount of cooked rice. I don't really
remember what amount I use. Also check on the difference in cooking
times for wild rice. Be sure to use a good quality curry powder. I go
to an oriental grocer and get Madras curry powder from India. It's much
better than most American versions.

STAYKA'S CHICKEN VINDALOO'N'PINEAPPLE
=====================================
(serves 2)
Ingredients:
-----------250g
chicken breast (or any other poultry)
1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes
1 can (250g) sweet corn (the little yellow thingies)
1 cup pineapple pieces (it was what I had left - add to taste...)
3 tsp vindaloo curry paste ++hot (be careful, dangerous stuff!)
2 tsp vindaloo curry powder ++hot (you can substitute hot chili powder)
0.5 - 1 cup soy sauce to marinate chicken in
Instructions:
------------1.) Slice chicken in small pieces (1 piece, 1 bite) and marinate in soy
sauce (ten minutes should suffice), then throw chicken + sauce into a
pan (don't throw over too far a distance, *you* have to clean up the
mess)
2.) Fry chicken in pan.
eat salmonellas.

Make sure it is well done, you don't want to

3.) Put the can of tomatoes + the can of sweet corn into the pan and
cook together with the chicken pieces (make sure to remove the cans
before cooking).
4.) Add vindaloo curry paste + powder (well, and if you like it *really
hot* - and I *mean* REALLY - also add some hot chili powder) and stir
until everything is well blended.

5.) Add pineapple pieces.
6.) Serve hot :-)
I *strongly* suggest that you start with half of the aforementioned
amount of vindaloo spice and add more to taste! It's always easier to
*add* something than trying to fish it out of the meal...
Normally I eat one serving for lunch and keep the second one for dinner.
I found it certainly addictive, once I got over the initial shock of the
added pineapple pieces. You can moderate the impact of this fiery stuff
(well, my teaspoons are rather well heaped) with an additional portion
of rice or nan (the wonderful Indian bread).
Variations:
----------When you like onions you can also add two finely chopped onions. As I
despise them, I don't... Other variations include adding 1 tsp finely
chopped ginger, 1 tbsp ground almonds, 1 tbsp ground cashew nuts, 1 tsp
lemon juice, 1 medium diced potato, 1 tbsp red vinegar. Just experiment
a bit with the additional ingredients. I only add those things when I
find them in the kitchen + I have enough time to do some experiments...

freezer in old yogurt/sherbert containers for a long time.
Bouillon granules are frequently high in salt and MSG, among other
nasties. Instead try salt-free spice mixes, such as Parsley Patch (R)
or Mrs. Dash (R), or add a little more scallions and peels.
Other orange-chicken recipes may ask for 1/8-1/4 tsp. ground cloves
(yum!), 1 Tbsp. honey, 1/4(+)tsp. cinnamon, and/or fresh or frozen
berries (cran, ras, black, etc.). Try mixing and matching to get your
own favorite blend.

pan over med heat, add seasoned chicken for 8-10 minutes, turning once.
Then continue with sauces as described above...

boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 can
cream of chicken soup
1 soup can of water
1 pkg
swiss cheese
1/2 stick
of butter
1 pkg
coarse bread crumbs

This is a recipe taken without perimission from Madhur
Jaffery's Far Eastern Cookery book. I forgot what it's
called, but the dish originates from Korea, I think.
Uses Hot Fermented Bean Paste....
6 pieces of chicken (normally I use dark meat)
4 medium potatoes
1 small onion
4 tablespoons light soy sauce
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons Hot Fermented Bean Paste (HFBP)
2 cups water
1 small red pepper
1 small green pepper
freshly ground pepper to taste
roasted sesame seeds (optional, but very good!)
Put the chicken in a large pot with light soy sauce and sugar.
Slowly add water to HFBP in a seperate bowl, mixing as you go.
Add this to the pot with chicken, bring to a boil, cover, reduce
heat and simmer 10 minutes. Add potatoes and onion, bring to a
boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes. Slice up red and
green pepper and add to chicken (add in pepper to taste). Simmer
5 more minutes and serve with roasted sesame seeds on top.
Great over rice and keeps for weeks. I usually have a pot of this
at home for the nights I come home hungry with not much time to cook.

This is how I make my Jambalaya.

It's a favorite in our house.

1 lb chicken meat (I get a package of boned, skinned breasts)
3/4 lb smoked sausage
2 cans chicken broth
1 med onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 med green pepper, chopped
cayenne pepper, to taste
(1-2 Tablespoons, depending how hot you like it. I use 3!)
16 oz bag white rice
1 small can tomato paste
4-5 green onions, chopped
1 med tomato, chopped
optional: shrimp, seafood

Cut the chicken and sausage into small or smaller than bite-sized pieces.
Season the chicken with salt and pepper ( I do this rather generously:
1 t pepper, 2 t salt, possibly more) Using a dutch oven on the stovetop,
Cook chicken and sausage in small amount of oil or lard (some authentics
swear it must be in lard) until the chicken is done; about 15 minutes.
Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.
Saute the onion, celery and green pepper until tender crisp. Add the
chicken broth, rice and cayenne pepper. Heat until the broth starts
to bubble, then stir the meat back in. Turn the heat down low and simmer
with the lid on for 30 minutes. DO NOT STIR during this time or some
of the rice will rise to the top out of the liquid and you'll get crunchy
jambalaya.
After the 30 minutes are up, stir in the tomato paste.

Some notes:
If you are adding shrimp, I usually cook is separately and add it just
before or with the paste. If you cook chrimp too long it gets rubbery.
It also doesn't keep well, if you don't plan to eat it all at one sitting.
If you are using other seafood in place of or in addition to the chicken,
you can add that at the normal meat addition, but I don't make this

version so I don't have any words of wisdom.

Also, I have been know to add the cayenne without measuring until the broth
turns a light orange color. This seems to be the right amount of spicyness,
but remember you can always add more. I told a friend to do this and she
added the full 3 T and said it was unedible it was so hot. You can always
add more broth or tomato paste to tone it down. Start with 1 t. - 1 T.
and add as you go until you find the right heat level. Personally, i like

2 chicken breasts (or equivalent in other part of chicken)
1 tin mangoes (or two fresh ones, which should be very ripe)
1 tsp coriander (dried)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 1 clove of garlic, finely chopped)
1 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp cumin
1 tsp cinnamon
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp Worcester sauce
Water if needed (see below)
1 carton natural yoghurt (to taste)
Fry all of the spices, except for half of the garlic, in a small amount of oil.
Drain the mangoes (if necessary) and puree them (or at least crush them a bit).
You may want to add some sugar if using fresh mangoes which are not so ripe.
Put the mangoes in with the spices, add soy and Worcester sauce, and cook
gently for 10 minutes (it will not matter if you leave it for longer).
Meanwhile, dice the chicken and fry until opaque, along with the rest of the
garlic. Drain off any excess oil. Add to the mango sauce and simmer gently
for 10-15 minutes. Serve over rice with the natural yogurt as an accompaniment.

Chicken "Wing" Pizza

Chicken "Wing" Pizza Date: Wed, 4 Aug 1993
03:40:45 -0400

There's a rather familiar recipe that
alot of people use to make what I
think are the *best* chicken wings in
existence...it's the ultimate in
casual cooking, and infallible...
1. Take 2-3 pounds of cut wings, but
them in a big bowl
2. Dump a big bottle of Durkee's Red
Pepper Hot Sauce over them
3. Pour white vinegar into the bowl
until it is almost full
4. Add enough oil to make just a thin
layer on top of the other liquid
5. Let it sit for an hour, then broil
the wings.
The wings are served with blue cheese
dip, sour cream or some of the
vinegar/pepper sauce for dipping. No
matter how much or little of each of

Chicken "Wing" Pizza

the ingredients, as long as they're all
there, it's an impossible recipe
to screw up.
This weekend we decided that we wanted
to imitate all these places that
are serving (insert restaurant's name)
style-chicken pizza (including the
Price Club!) so, after being goaded on
by the people who tell me I make
good wings, I experimented, and out
came:
Thespian's Spicy Grilled Chicken Pizza
- The crust is left up to you..I was
lazy and used Boboli :)
- The pizza sauce is left up to you..I
used the last of my homemade from last
year..
- mozzarella cheese, shredded about a
c. per pizza but also to taste
- olive oil
- a small bottle of Durkee's sauce
- white vinegar

Chicken "Wing" Pizza

- 2-3 boneless chicken breasts
- sundried tomatoes
- crushed dried peppers for sprinkling
on finished pizza
Like with the wings, the chicken
breasts get soaked in Durkee's and
vinegar. If you are going to broil
them, you'll need oil in the mix
again; since it's that time of year I
barbecued them, and the oil wasn't
really needed. Cook the chicken and
cut it into small chunks. Lightly
baste the whole pizza crust, including
the edges with the olive oil. Mix a
bit of the hot pepper sauce into the
pizza sauce and spread that over the
pizza crust. Put the dried tomatoes on
top of the sauce, cover with
mozzarella, and spread the chunked
chicken evenly over the pizza. If
you're a masochist like me, splash on
more hot sauce (g).
Becuase I used a pre-cooked crust, my

This is a fast dish that is often requested by family and friends.
It reheats well in the microwave and the aroma drives people at work crazy.
juice of 1 lemon
1/2 tsp lemon zest
2 quarter sized slices of ginger finely minced
1 clove garlic finely minced
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup white wine or dry sherry (use chicken stock if preferred)
4 boneless and skinless chicken breast or thigh (serves 2 to 4)
chopped scallion (green onion) or slices mushrooms are optional
salt and pepper to taste
pound chicken flat
heat a fry pan and add 1 tbl each olive oil and butter (or more to coat pan
depending upon size being used - you're sauteing, not frying)
lightly flour chicken and saute quickly till light golden on both
sides (approx 3-4 mins each side for med to med high heat); add ginger,
lemon zest, garlic, salt and pepper to the pan when you flip to side 2
remove to warming plate in oven while finishing up
turn up the heat on the pan and deglaze with wine, chicken stock,
and lemon juice; add scallion and/or mushrooms if used
when reduced to half add the parsley and return the chicken and any
accumulated juices to the pan for reheating; turning to heat through
then serve immediately.
I usually serve this with some type of rice or grain pilaf and
a simple vegetable or salad.
Total time for chicken prep start to finish is about 15 minutes.
Kids love to pound the chicken, just place it between two sheets of
plastic wrap to keep if from being sprayed all over the place.
This also works well with veal (use marsala or madeira or sherry)
and pork (any of the previous wines or try using a port for a rich
earthy flavor). Another option is to use lime or orange with a light
touch of tarragon or basil.

My wife taught me how to make this. She learned it in Greece, where it's
a common meal. It's incredibly delicious, and while it's cooking, the smell
will have everyone in the house salivating. She cooks it in an open pan, but
I find the chicken stays moister if you cover it (with aluminum foil or something) for the first half-hour or so. Either way, it tastes great!
Ingredients:
Four pieces of boneless, skinless chicken breasts
juice of two lemons
four or five potatoes, peeled and sliced french-fry style
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 to 1 cup of water
one head of garlic, the cloves peeled but whole
oregano, salt, and pepper to taste
Procedure:
Place chicken in a shallow baking tray.
Arrange potatoes around chicken pieces. Scatter whole peeled cloves of
garlic around chicken and potatoes.
Mix together lemon juice and olive oil, and pour evenly over chicken
and potatoes. Add water until potatoes are just about covered.
Add salt, pepper to taste.
amounts of oregano.

Cover chicken and pototoes with generous

Bake at 350 degrees, until tops of chicken are reddish brown.
Turn chicken, stir potatoes, and sprinkle on more oregano. If potatoes
aren't at least half-covered with liquid, add water.
Return to oven for about 15-20 minutes. Chicken is done when both
sides a lightly browned and potatoes are soft when touched with
a fork.
Serve with a crusty bread, or with pita bread.

From: jafo@miranda.accum.com (Sean Reifschneider)

Cut chicken breasts into bite size chunks. Heat oil in wok (I use
peanut) and put 2 to 3 cloves of garlic in to season oil. When oil is
hot, put one tablespoon of crushed red peppers in the oil (vary to
preference) and put in the chicken and about a quarter cup of chopped
onions. Cook until mostly done (perhaps still a bit pink inside).
Sizzle in 3 TBS soy sauce (pour around edges of wok so it heats as it
runs down the sides), 1TBS rice wine vinegar, 1/2TBS Sessame oil, half
cup water, half TBS Tobasco sauce and push chicken and veggies up along
the sides of the wok. Cook covered until veggies are done to your taste
(about 7-10 minutes).
Add quarter cup of sugar to sauce in bottom of wok and 1-2TBS corn
starch, 1TBS Sessame seeds and cook until desired thickness is reached.
Serve over rice.
This makes 'regular' sessame chicken. I've had little luck getting
'crispy' sessame chicken to be crispy, but basically my best attempts
were with using corn starch on the chicken and frying it. Then
basically following the recipe above (which hopefully I haven't
forgotten anything :) without the cooking the ckicken part.

Spicy Grilled Chicken and Potatoes

Spicy Grilled Chicken and Potatoes
From: cschnell@iiasa.ac.at (Carey SCHNELL)
Date: Tue, 3 Aug 1993 07:32:20 GMT

Ingredients for four:
Chicken for four
Potatoes for four
Spices: Mild chili, salt and pepper, parsley, ginger...
Water
Oil of your choice (I use chili and olive oil..)
What I do is take enough chicken with skin on, to feed 4 appetites.
Boil it for 10-15 minutes.
Allow to cool a little, then dust it with spices:
Spice Mix:
2 tspns MILD chili
1 tspn pepper
half tspn salt
2 tspns parsley
half tspn ginger
Have the oven pre-heated to a moderate temperature
On a lightly greased oven tray, lay the chicken pieces skin side up.
The boiling process takes most of the fat from the chicken, and leaves
you with a nice stock that you can freeze for later use.
The baking will also give off a little fat, and you should baste the
chicken with this to keep it moist. You basically cook the chicken
in the oven for around 15-20 mins from this point.
At the same time, I will have prepared potatoes to go into the oven with
the chook. (More instructions follow in the taties recipe)
Sliced and spicy potaties
Enough potatoes for 4 persons, and then 2 for luck.
Scrub but don't peel. Slice thickly, approx half inch thick. Lay onto
the oven tray, but make sure both sides have a little grease on them
otherwise they will stick to the tray. You may need to add a little more
oil (I use chili oil, but that may be a little hot for The Parents).
Keep an eye on these little suckers, as they will cook pretty quickly.

Spicy Grilled Chicken and Potatoes

The idea is that they will bubble up towards the end, and you will
need to turn them over to get them all toasty on the other side as well.
Sprinkle the potatoes and the chicken (make sure you turn them over
at some stage in the cooking as well, but they should end up skin side up
to make sure the skin doesn't get soggy) with the spice mix throughout
the cooking time, to get the flavour through.
In the meantime, prepare a simple tossed salad with a simple
dressing so as not to compete with the flavour of the chook.
Serve with the salad and a good Turkish bread (one of the ones
that you rip apart, or a crusty one if you want something a little
more elegant

The chicken can be either boiled or microwaved. Break the cooked and boned
chicken into bite sized pieces. Reserve about one cup of the stock.
Saute the onion and pepper in oil until the onion is transluscent. Add the
stewed tomatoes and stir. Add the salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin and
oregano and blend thoroughly. When this has started to boil, add the
reserved stock (you may substitute one cup of chicken bouilon). Simmer for
about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Prepare rice according to package directions ( 1 1/2 cups, uncooked).
Add the corn starch to a little water and blend. Add to the tomato
mixture and blend well, stirring as it thickens. Add about one half of the
chicken and the cilantro while stirring. When this mixture has thickened,
place the rice in a large greased baking dish (9 1/2 x 9 1/2 x 2),
spreading it over the bottom. Place the reserved chicken over this and
pour the chicken tomato mixture over all. Cover. Thoroughly heat in a

Zen Barbecue Chicken

Zen Barbecue Chicken
From: Thomas Fenske
Date: Tue, 2 Nov 1993 09:59:10 -0500 (EST)
No one asked, but...
Some years ago I learned the secrets of chicken barbecue from a Zen
Chicken Master. Here they are, revealed for the first time:
1. The chicken. Don't even bother to try barbecuing chicken breasts.
They end up dry and tasteless. Use mainly thighs; they're tastier and
have enough fat to be self-basting.
2. The sauce. Start by bringing to a boil a bottle of vinegar with a
large finely chopped onion. Simmer until the onion is very soft. Add a
small box dark brown sugar (what's that- a pound?) and cook until
dissolved and smooth.
To this add a bottle of Open Pit barbecue sauce. Finally, add the Secret
Ingredients:
1/2c Hoisin Sauce
1 jar orange marmelade.
Hot sauce to taste.
3. The cooking: Don't add the sauce until the chicken is almost done. Brush
and turn a couple of times. The finished product should be a sticky mess.

Roast Leg of Lamb

Leg of lamb (about 6 pounds)
8 clove garlic
juice of one lemon
1/2 teaspoon rosemary
salt
freshly ground black pepper
Preheat oven to 325F. Cut eight shallow slits in the surface of the
lamb and insert a clove of garlic in each slit. Brush the lamb with
lemon juice, sprinkle with rosemary, salt and pepper. Insert a meat
thermometer into the thickest part of the roast so the bulb reaches
the center but does not touch a bone. Place the lamb on a rack in a
roasting pan and roast for about 20 minutes per pound or until the
thermomoeter reaches 150F. Remove from oven, and let the leg stand
uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.

Yucatan leg of lamb

1 whole leg of lamb (approx. 6.5 pounds)
1.5 tbsp. cumin seeds
3
tbsp. black peppercorns
3
tbsp. dried orregano leaves
3
tbsp. dried thyme leaves
..5 tsp. sea salt (I use regular salt)
3-4 dried chipotle chile (essential - these are smoked jalapeno)
3
tbsp. olive oil
8 - 10 prickly pear cactus pads (optional - these are sold as nopales)
salt and pepper to taste
6 cups reserved lamb stock (I use beef stock with equally good
results)
Preheat oven to 325
Trim fell and fat from leg of lamb. (The fell is is what gives lamb
its strong taste. It is important to remove it as thoroughly as
possible). Remove hip bone with a boning knife (I usually leave this
on, it just makes carving the lamb a little more difficult). Re-form
the lamb and tie tightly with kitchen string. Make a stock with the
bones and trimmings and set lamb aside, covered with plastic wrap.
In a small iron skillet, saute the cumin seeds, peppercorns, orregano,
and thyme over medium heat to release their flavours. Stir frequently
and remove when they turn brown and start to smoke. Add salt and one
broken chipotle chili, and grind the mixture into a fine powder in a
clean coffee grinder.
Rub lamb with olive oil and then coat uniformly with generous amounts
of the spice mixture. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting and roast
for 1 hour and 15 minutes - until a meat thermometer registers an
internal temperature of 120 F. Rasie heat to 450 F to brown exterior
for 5 to 10 minutes (the meat thermometer is important to judge the
doneness of the meat). The internal temperature should rise to 130 F.

meat juices to be reabsorbed.
While the lamb is roasting, wash the prickly pear cactus pads in cold
water, after removing the thorns with a paring knife, brush with olive
oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over a low charcoal fire
or under a broiler for about 5 min. per side or until tender.
To make the sauce, pour the fat from the roasting pan and add the
lamb stock (or beef stock in my case), and remaining broken chipotles.
Reduce over high heat, stirring occasionally, until stock is reduced
by two-thirds. Adjust seasoning. Carve lamb and serve on the platter
with rice, garnish with cactus pads and spoon sauce over meat.
Note: Lamb can marinate overnight in the refrigerator, covered with
plastic wrap. It is important to let it sit at room temperature for
4 hours before cooking.

Julia Child's method of butterflying the leg is best in my opinion.
Simply butterfly it and place in a dish or glass roasting pan to marinate

lamb is a treat I save for restaurants.

This is not

Leg of Lamb : COLLECTION

a particularly easy process, but it lets you roast the lamb in 1/3 the
time of doing it "as is".
To butterfly the leg of lamb, you'll slit down to the bone where it lies
closest to the surface, and then cut it out carefully. Use a sharp
knife! You'll also need to get out the kneecap, which is not hard, but
a pain. When you're done, you'll have exposed a thick vein of fat that
was next to the bone; trim this out as well.
When you're done, you'll have a mess. :-) Essentially, you've
"unwrapped" the meat from around the bone, so that it can lie flat on a
roasting pan. If there are any particularly thick parts that won't lie
flat, slit them (in the direction that the bone used to run) so they
will.
You may wish to cut off the portion of meat closest to the shank (the
narrow end), because the white tendons there can make that meat tough.
Use it for stock, or remove the tendons and use the rest for shish
kabob... use your imagination. Don't waste it; it's *lamb*! :-)
Now, mix up the marinade, put the lamb into a plastic bag (Ziploc or
similar self-sealing bags work extremely well) and pour the marinade
over it. Work it through the bag with your fingers to coat the lamb,
seal the bag, and put it into the refrigerator. Marinade it for at
least an hour; overnight is better.
To cook - this is the method that Julia Child calls "broil-roasting;" it
produces very good results in a surprisingly short time. Arrange the
lamb on a roasting pan, butterflied out so that it lies flat, with the
"skin" side (i.e. the outside, not the meaty part that lay against the
bone) up. Put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. Yes, you read that
right - just a couple of minutes. This is to seal the surface.
Now, move the lamb to a preheated 375 Farenheit (190 Centigrade) oven
and roast for about 20 minutes, depending on how thick it is and your
desired degree of doneness.
When it's done, take it out and let it sit at room temperature for 10
minutes before carving, in order to let the meat reabsorb the juices.
Butterflied lamb is a breeze to carve, but less tidy-looking than a
straight roasted leg.

LOWFAT LAMB RECIPE
==================
Ingredients:
-----------lamb gigot chops (slices across the leg, with the bone removed)
breadcrumbs (1 slice of bread ground in a food processor)
1 clove chopped garlic
1 handful of parsley
Dijon mustard
a little vegetable stock
Instructions:
------------Use lamb gigot chops (these are slices across the leg, with the bone
removed.) Cut off all visible fat.
Start by making a mix of breadcrumbs and chopped garlic and parsley, to
taste (I put a slice of not-quite-fresh bread in a food processor with a
clove of garlic and a handful of fresh parsley).
Heat a heavy pan without adding any fat - a non-stick frying pan for
example. I used a shallow Le Creuset casserole for the whole thing.
When its really hot, drop in the lamb chops. They should seal at once.
Count to about 20, then turn. Count to 20 again. The chops should be a
definate brown. Lift out of pan and place in roasting tin. Spread a
thick layer of Dijon mustard onto chops. Put a thick layer of crumb
mixture on top - its OK if some falls off into the dish. Cook at 220 C
(sorry don't kow other measures) for 20 minutes. Remove from oven.
Lift out chops to warmed serving dish. Place roasting tin on top of
stove and deglaze with a little vegetable stock. Thicken with
cornflour/arrowroot if you like.
Pour gravy over and serve.
I served this with baked potatoes (this is the correct UK spelling) and
steamed veggies (broccoli, mange-tout and baby sweet-corn). It was

lovely.
A variant might be to deglaze the pan with a little red wine, and
thicken with redcurrant jelly.
This was really yummy, and my non-dieting hubby loved it too. I had two
very small chops (probably totalled 4oz) He had two very large chops.

water, after removing the thorns with a paring knife, brush with olive
oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill over a low charcoal fire
or under a broiler for about 5 min. per side or until tender.
To make the sauce, pour the fat from the roasting pan and add the lamb
stock (or beef stock in my case), and remaining broken chipotles.
Reduce over high heat, stirring occasionally, until stock is reduced by
two-thirds. Adjust seasoning. Carve lamb and serve on the platter with
rice, garnish with cactus pads and spoon sauce over meat.
Note:
----Lamb can marinate overnight in the refrigerator, covered with plastic
wrap. It is important to let it sit at room temperature for 4 hours
before cooking.

GYROS (pronounced sort of like 'yeeros')
=====
(Serves 6 or 7)
Ingredients:
-----------2 lb
lean ground lamb
2 slices homemade bread, toasted and crushed
1 tsp
allspice, pounded (ground)
1 tsp
coriander, crushed
1 clove
garlic, crushed
1
onion, grated
1 tsp
fresh savory, chopped
Salt and freshly ground pepper (to taste)
3 slices bacon
6 to 8
Middle Eastern breads, or any substitute bread or roll
2 tomatoes, chopped or sliced thin and seasoned with vinegar and
olive oil
1 cup
fresh parsley, chopped
1 cup
plain yogurt (I would probably strain the yogurt)
Instructions:
------------In a large bowl, combine the above ingredients up to and including the
salt and pepper, and knead thoroughly. Mixture should be spicy but not
too herby, and hold its shape. Break into 5 sections, each the size of
a navel orange, then break each section into 6 balls. Knead and flatten
slightly to a thickness of about 3/4 inch.
Cut the bacon slices into widths equal to the meatballs and place a
slice on each one. Continue shaping the balls, keeping the slices of
bacon between them. Slip a cane skewer through the centers and roll
gently with the palms to smooth the edges (you will need 5 or 6 skewers
total, depending on their size). Cover and refrigerate overnight.
(Note: I interpret the above instructions as resulting in the meat
skewered something like so:
--O)O)O)O)O)--

where 'O'=meatball and ')'=bacon slice

To cook, set on a broiler tray or grill and cook over/under moderate
heat, turning every 5 minutes. The surface will be crusty and the
inside cooked within 25 minutes.
To serve, put out the pitta, meat, tomatoes, parsley and yogurt in
separate dishes. Let guests open the bread or rolls and stuff them with
meat and garnishings to their taste.

matters) Mix with meat for 10 minutes (continue to let it simmer...) Now
add 1 3/4 cup broth; reserve remaining broth in case you need more...
Keep checking until rice is cooked. Stir occaisonally.

Divide meat in half.
Then add:

Make bottom layer.

Flatten with hands until even.

1/3 cup snobar (pine nuts) or pignoli seeds

LAMB RIB RECIPE
===============
I normaly use this on a butterfly-boned leg of lab (cut along the bone
on the flat side and remove the leg bone) but I tried it on a side of
lamb, about 6 ribs, last week and it worked well.
Marinade for lamb:
-----------------olive oil
lemon juice
garlic - sliced or crushed
lots of black pepper
ground bay leaves (lots and lots)
Instructions:
------------Smear the lamb thoroughly with the marinade and leave to settle for a
while. Heat your grill to very hot and then grill the lamb for 6-8
minutes on one side, 4-6 minutes on the other, until nicely browned and
sizzling. Warning - this is messy and spits a bit so watch out! Baste
with any extra marinade when you turn the lamb.
If your grill is in the oven, you can just turn it
in the excess heat for 20 minutes (this results in
cooked lamb on a leg, crispy brown lamb on ribs).
to 200 degrees C, put the lamb in and turn off the
for 20 minutes.

off and leave to cook
pink and perfectly
If not, heat the oven
heat. Again, leave

Wrap the lamb in foil and leave to rest for another 5-10 minutes while
you get salad and potatoes and spinach and tomatoes and bread ready to
serve, then carve - leg goes across the grain in chunks, ribs along the
bone.

of 1/2 lemon
(a little smaller than a teaspoon) salt
of 1-2 lemons
(2 tblsp or so) oil (olive oil)
(ca. 1/2 cup) white wine or water

Instructions:
------------Cut the meat into small cubes. In a bowl, preferably earthenware, mix
the marinade ingredients well and add the meat, mix again, cover and
leave to marinate for 24 to 48 hours. (He doesn't say to refrigerate
but I would certainly do so. For the curious, the recipe actually calls
for marinating in a _kioupi_ or earthenware storage jar rather than a
bowl. This would probably keep the ingredients cooler.) When ready to
cook, thread the meat on 18 to 24 skewers. Grill over embers of vine
branches (!). Serve hot.

to taste, a 3" stick of cinnamon and 2 tbsp of tomato paste mixed with 1

Now transfer if necessary to a buttered Yuvetsi or oven-proof casserole.
Add 1 Qt. of stock (chicken is fine or what have you)
Orzo ( Kritharaki to a Greek) 2 cups poured over and leveled out.
Now bake at 375F for 40 minutes or so or until the lamb is tender and
liquid has absorbed. Stir, uncover and bake 10 minutes more. Remove and
let stand for 10 minutes or so covered with a dry kitchen towel.
Note:
----The recipe is named for the earthenware pot with the clay-coloured
interior and curved handles used to cook this typical dish.
The recipe I use may be considered to be in the Cyprus style.
Technically a Yuvetsi can be made with any type of pasta, macaroni etc.,
but to me a real yuvetsi is always made with kritharaki.

Dredge the liver pieces in flour and fry quickly. Use some of the bacon

hour to 45 minutes over a low flame. Add a few twists of fresh ground
black pepper.
Place the liver on a plate on top of the onions. Pour off almost all of
the grease left from frying the liver. Add some stock and bring almost
all of the grease left over from the liver, and add some stock scraping
up the brown bits and bring to a boil. Add a splash of cognac or red wine.
Add some fresh, chopped rosemary and some black pepper and cook for a

1 T honey
2 T sugar
3 T vinegar
1 T soy sauce
2 T dry white wine
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 t grated ginger
2 T tomato paste
1 t tabasco or hot pepper sauce

Cut each liver in two, clean from fat, tendons, etc. Mix marinade

using frozen liver, make sure it is completely thawed.
Drain liver, dredge each piece in flour, and deep fry.
Drain on paper towels.

Do not overcook.

Put sauce ingredients in a small pan, bring to a boil stirring constantly.
Mix cornstarch and water and add to the sauce to thicken it.
Pour half the sauce into a serving plate, arrange liver pieces on the
sauce, and pour remainder of sauce over the liver. Sprinkle green onion,
almonds, and a few drops of sesame oil over everything.
Chicken Livers with Hot Mustard Sauce

Take about a pound of chicken livers, cut off the connective material,
and cut into pieces about the size of the last joint of your thumb. The
smaller the pieces, the crispier this will be, and the less liver flavor
will be present. Thumb-sized is a good place to start.
Throw a couple of handfull of flour in a paper bag, along with 1 teaspoon
of salt and 2 teaspoons of ground nutmeg. Throw the liver into the bag
one piece at a time, bouncing the bag a little between each addition,
until you have maybe a dozen pieces of liver in the bag. Hold the open
end of the bag closed, and shake vigorously to coat the liver. Put the
floured liver pieces on a plate and continue the process until all liver
is floured.
Fry liver in hot oil 1/4" deep, until coating is crispy.
Put 4-6 teaspoons of dry mustard in a teacup, and add water, stirring

Take the mixture off the stove and add enough catsup to change the color
from yellow to a light orange. After this mixture is cool add the
mustard/water mixture to taste.
Liver with Wine & Onion Sauce

750g liver (1.65 lbs)
1 tbsp butter
1 tsp flour or cornstarch
1 tbsp finely chopped onion or more
1 tsp finely chopped parsley
1 cup stock
1/2 cup wine
1/2 tbsp tomato paste
salt, pepper
Clean the liver of all membranes and vessels, cut into pieces. In a
pot heat up 1 tbsp butter, when hot add the liver; cook for a few
minutes, turning it a few times to brown evenly. Add salt and pepper,
finely chopped onion, parsley. Sprinkle 1 with tsp flour. Let it
brown a couple of minutes. Pour in the wine, the stock, and a little
tomato paste. Bring to a boil. Serve.
Salade Lyonnaise

Here is a delicious, quick salad where the liver characteristic flavor (a minus
for many) becomes actually a plus when combined with the rest:
1) Take some old bread, sourdough or other dense texture, dice into croutons,
put in the oven to brown (1.5 cups)
2) Take the liver(s) you have, likewise dice, sautee with a little onion or
garlic (1 cup before cooking) (you could also let it cook one minute in
a little wine if you have an open bottle)
3) Take a lettuce head, the red-green variety (not radicchio, which is bitter),
with soft leaves, cut leaves into 1 inch slices
4) Prepare mustard de Dijon by whipping 2tsp mustard and 3tbsp veg. oil with
a fork or spoon. Will make a mousse. Add more oil if you think it can be
absorbed in the mousse.
Combine all ingredients in bowl, toss and serve with red wine. If
liver and bread settle at the bottom of bowl, you may have used a
lettuce with too stiff leaves or have sliced them too big.

Pork Chops - 2 recipes
From: joseph@inland.com (Roger Joseph)
Date: 21 Jul 93 10:31:11 CST

Here are two variants on grilled pork chops that I have tried in the
past couple weeks.
Grilled pork chops with Blue Cheese
Thick lean pork chops (or pork steaks)
A-1 Sauce
Kitchen Bouquet
Garlic powder (opt.)
Crumbled Blue Cheese
Healthy Choice Blue Cheese Salad Dressing (or equiv.)
Coat chops with Kitchen Bouquet and A-1 sauce and sprinkle with garlic
powder if desired. Allow to marinate for 30 min. or so while getting
the barbie going. Grill chops over medium heat about 10 min. per side.
Time will depend on thickness of chops. During last 5 min. sprinkle
crumpled blue cheese over chops and then cover with the blue cheese
dressing. Cover grill and allow the cheese to melt. Enjoy with good
friends and a bottle of good cab.
Grilled Pork Chops Dijonaise
Thick lean pork chops (or pork steaks)
Garlic powder
White pepper
Kitchen Bouquet
Dijonaise (Dijon mustard sauce from Heilmanns)
Coat chops all over with Kitchen Bouquet and sprinkle with garlic powder
and white pepper to taste (optional). Coat one side of chops with
Dijonaise and allow to marinate for 30 min. while getting the grill
up to temp. Grill chops over medium heat until done ~10min./side.
Serve with additional Dijonaise and a nice bottle of chard.

"....The recipe is in the Jan/Feb 1979 issue of Cuisine. I started
back from my last issue, sometime in 83 I think. It was an interesting
journey.
Cuisine has a had some name changes over the years. It was originally
called SPHERE, put out by Betty Crocker( I believe the magazine title
said The Betty Crocker Sphere magazine, or something). Then
they started calling it juse Sphere. By the end of 1978, they started
calling it Sphere's CUISINE magazine. Then, with this issue, at
the start of 79, just CUISINE.

I find this needs some more veggies so I chop up some bok choy or

mixture up in a lettuce leaf like an eggroll of sorts.
1/2 lb dried cellophane noodles
1 lb lean ground pork or beef
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 tbsp sesame-seed oil

Put the cellophane noodles in a large bowl and cover them with 1 quart
(1 liter) boiling water. Set them aside to soak for at least 20 minutes.
Put the ground pork in a bowl and add to it 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of soy
sauce and the sesame-seed oil. Add half of the scallions to the pork and
mix well; set the rest of the scallions aside.
When the cellophane noodles have become soft, rinse them several times
under cold running water and drain them well.
Heat your wok over high heat for 15 seconds, then pour in the peanut oil.
When the oil is ready, toss in the ginger and garlic and add the hot-pepper
paste. Stir fry these ingredient together for 30 seconds. Add the meat
and continue to stir fry for about one minute, taking particular care to
break up any large chunks of meat. Pour in the remaining soy sauce and stir
fry everything for 30 seconds longer. Add the cellophane noodles to the
pan and cook for about one minute, turning the noodles over occasionally.
After a minute, add the scallions and the water then cover the pan and
let simmer over medium heat for 3 or 4 minutes.

In the spirit of the White Castle hamburger and Taco Bell hot sauce,
I bring you Old Spagetti Factory Meatballs. I'd surely use a better
sauce than the plain 30 oz of tomato sauce called for, but you're on
your own for that part.
/Sandra
vigil@esca.com
.......................................................................
by way of "By Request", a Seattle Times Column

1/3 cup very finely chopped onion
1 Tbsp very finely minced garlic
3 Tbsp finely chopped parsley
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 egg
1/2 cup cold water

2 Tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp - 1 Tbsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
2 1/2 lb lean ground chuck
30 oz tomato sauce

Combine chopped onion, garlic, parsley and bread crumbs in a food
processor and mix 30 seconds.
Break the egg into a 3 quart bowl and mix well using a wire whisk. Add
water, olive oil, salt, pepper, and nutmeg to the egg and whisk until
well whisked.
Add the bread crumb mixture, combining with a spatula. Add the ground
meat and mix thoroughly until ingredients are well distributed and the
mixture is binding together tightly.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using a medium sized ice cream
scoop, scoop out a portion onto a lightly oiled jelly roll pan. Form
each meatball by rolling in the palm of your hand until they feel
tight and solid. (The finished meatballs should be about the size of
a golf ball.)
Pour 1/4 cup water into the pan and place in the oven. Time 15
minutes. Remove from the oven and loosen with a spatula. Return to
the oven an additional 10 minutes, or until cooked through. Drain.

Roast Loin of Venison with Cranberries
From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 06:43:09 GMT

2 thick slices of lemon
2 thick slices of orange
2 slices of peeled fresh ginger
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 small bay leaf
2 cups fresh cranberries
4 pounds boneless loin of venison, at room temperature
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper
3/4 teaspoon finely chopped juniper berries
2 cups dry red wine
2 cups beef or venison stock
2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into pieces
Fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish
In a medium nonreactive saucepan, combine the lemon, orange, ginger,
sugar and bay leaf with 1 cup of cold water. Bring to a boil over high
heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to moderate and
boil, uncovered, until syrupy, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in the cranberries, then remove from heat and cool. Transfer the
mixture to a glass container, coer and refrigerate for 1 to 2 days,
stirring once or twice during that time.
Preheat the oven to 400F. Rub the venison with the olive oil, 3/4
teaspoon of the salt, 1 teaspoon of the pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of
the chopped juniper berries, pressing the seasonings into the meat.
Set the loin on a rack in a roasting pan and roast, basting frequently
with the pan juices, until medium-rare (about 135F on a meat thermometer),
25 to 30 minutes. Cover the venison loosely with foil and set aside for
10 to 15 minutes before carving.
Meanwhile, remove and discard the bay leaf and the lemon, orange and
ginger slices from the cranberries. In a food processor or blender,
puree half the cranberries and half the liquid until smooth.
In a medium nonreactive saucepan, boil the wine over high heat until
reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 mintues. Add the stock and bring to a boil.
Add the cranberry puree, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered,

Spiedies

Spiedies
From: paul@hsh.com (Paul Havemann)
Date: 22 Jul 93 15:20:07 EDT

A variation on shishkebab, spiedies are native to -- and very popular in
-- the upstate areas of New York State, though they may be found in the
contiguous portions of neighboring states, including northern
Pennsylvania. Natives of upstate NY who have moved away from the area
have been known to have commercial "spiedie sauce" shipped, by the case,
to their new home!
Spiedies are very easy to prepare and to cook. Thanks to all the folks
in alt.culture.upstate-ny for their thoughts and contributions!
The Meat:
--------Cut your choice of meat into cubes, about 1 1/2" or so. Boneless
skinless chicken breast comes out very tender, but most meats (lamb,
pork, beef, venison) will make fine spiedies. If you use beef, use a
more tender cut so that it doesn't come out too tough. Veal,
especially, may come out tough unless left to marinate for several (3 to
4) days. Mixing two or more meats is very tasty.
Even some kinds of fish steaks (salmon, shark) have been used, but these
need only "marinate" for a half hour or so; or, just brush on the
marinade from another batch while grilling.

The Sauce:
---------Most bottled commercial spiedie mixtures, such as Salamida's, are both
expensive and use a little too much oil for some tastes. This recipe
(actually a vinaigrette) produces a more tangy sauce, and will marinate
anywhere from one to three pounds of meat.
8 bay leaves (crumbled up)
4 tsp oregano
8 sm cloves of fresh garlic, minced
1/2 C lemon juice
1/2 C salad oil or fruity olive oil (preferred)
3/4 C vinegar (any variety)
1 tsp pepper

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/meat/spiedies.html (1 of 2) [12/17/1999 11:23:30 AM]

Spiedies

3 tsp salt (or to taste)
(If using lamb, try adding a couple of mint leaves)
Mix all ingredients together in a non-metallic dish. Add meat, cover,
and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours; stir
occasionally. Olive oil will solidify when refrigerated, so remove the
spiedies once or twice per day to allow the oil to 'melt', then stir.
Spiedies can be left marinating for 2 to 5 days; some claim that they
can be left for a week or more! (Longer marinating may help make
beef & veal more tender.) Add more marinade if required.

To Cook:
-------Purists insist that spiedies must be skewered, shishkebab style, and
grilled on the barbecue for just a few minutes. Brush marinade on them
occasionally. Do not overcook! The marinated meat (especially chicken)
takes on a color that makes it difficult to tell when it's done.
Health considerations suggest that you do *not* use leftover marinade on
your spiedies at the serving table, since the raw meat will leave all
manner of unhealthy bacteria in it; reserve some of the marinade (or
make a fresh batch) to serve at table.
Spiedies are best eaten on large sliced hunks of French or Italian
bread; the accepted method is to grasp the bread in one hand, place the
skewer inside it, and pull the skewer out, leaving the spiedies inside
the bread. (Certainly, it saves time!) Kids, however, often prefer to
eat them right off the skewer.
Leftovers (if any) keep well in the fridge for several days.

burn away).
Do NOT stuff the turkey other than a few onions or garlics. (I forget
why, but it is important not to do so). Slather the turkey up with
vegetable oil and season (salt/pepper). Loosely truss up the legs. Put
on a poultry rack.
Put the turkey in the rack in the center of the grill over the drip pan.
Cover the grill. Add 2-3 coals per side every half hour. Cook 11-13
minutes per pound (eg. 132-156 minutes for a 12 pound turkey).
You can add wood chips for smoked flavor if desired to the coals just
before you put the turkey in. Add more as time goes on.
The turkey meat comes out absolutely moist as moist can be, even the
white meat. You may want to foil protect the wings if they start to
look a little *too* golden brown towards the end of the cooking.

Turkey : COLLECTION

1/4 tsp

ground anise

Instructions:
------------Place the turkey pieces in a large pot, cover with water, add salt,
bring quickly to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until nearly done, about
an hour. Remove from the heat and pat dry with towels.
While the turkey simmers, while wearing rubber gloves, wash the chiles
under running water, removing the stems, breaking them open and removing
the seeds. If you insist on preparing the chile bare-handed, do NOT
touch your eyes, nose, or any other senstive part of your body (or those
of any loved one). Place the chiles in a large bowl, and cover with the
chicken stock. Let soak half an hour, reserving the stock afterwards.
Place the almonds in a blender and reduce to a relatively fine chop.
Place in the blender the chiles, spices, raisins, dried tortilla,
tomatoes, garlic, and onion in a blender, along with a little of the
stock in which the chiles were soaked, and reduce to a smooth paste.
In a large frying pan, melt the bacon fat and brown the pieces of
turkey, having first patted them dry with towels. Place the browned
turkey pieces in an oven-proof baking dish. Add a little more bacon
fat, if necessary, and spoon in the chile paste. Fry it over medium
heat, for about 5 minutes, slowly adding about 2 cups of the stock in
which the chiles were soaked. Finally add the chocolate, and stir well
until it has melted. The sauce should be the consistency of thick cream
or a medium cream sauce. Pour the sauce over the turkey, cover, and
place the baking dish in a 350~ oven for about 45 minutes. Remove,
sprinkle the sesame seeds over the top.
Serve with Mexican rice, beans, "rajas en crema", sliced avocados, and
lots of fresh, warm, soft corn tortillas. Personally we prefer the blue
corn tortillas which are available in the fall in Mexico.
Note:
----This recipe, and various others I have posted is from a cook-book my
wife and I wrote and published here locally, for limited distribution to
out friends two years ago. As you can see it is an anecdotal cookbook,
telling of our lives in Mexico, Peru, and Spain, where we have lived on
and off for quite a while. The recipes were those we collected as we
went along, and have incorporated into our daily lives.

--------------------If Mexico could have a national dish, and to attempt to select just one
from the wide repertoire available is nearly impossible, it must be

mole. The dish originally came from the Convent of Santa Clara in
Puebla. According to the legend the sauce was concocted by the nuns in
honor of their bishop, don Alonso de la Mota y Escobar, specifically for
Lent. In the sixteenth century the custom of not eating meat in Lent
did not apply to fowl. Consequently in honor of the bishop's visit one
Lent the nuns made a chocolate sauce, "in order to sweeten our sins."
Thank heavens for a little conventual sin!
The name mole comes from the Nahuatl "molli," which comes from the
verb-stem "mola" meaning to grind something, since the most important
part of the whole recipe is the grinding of the spices. Curiously this
is very close to the Spanish word for grind, "moler." Each major town
and city in Mexico has a "molino" or mill. This mill is dedicated to
grinding spices. The various mixes are then displayed in white enamel
pans in the shop windows. There are ground chiles, spices, and nuts, as
well as prepared pastes, such as mole poblano, adobo, and achiote. The
colors run the gamut from bright greens to earthy reds and browns, even
purple, The scent from that shop is like to die and go to heaven, or
sneeze as you go by.

1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 teaspoons powdered mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
Few drops of hot pepper sauce
3 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 egg, beaten
3 1/2 cups grated sharp Cheddar cheese (about 3/4 pound)
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon paprika
Preheat the oven to 350F.

Butter a shallow 2 quart baking dish.

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the macaroni until
tender but still firm, about 8 minutes. Drain well.
Meanwhile, in a small heavy saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer over
moderate heat. Removed from the heat and stir in the powdered mustard,
Worcestershire sauce, salt and hot pepper sauce. Set the seasoned milk
aside.
Transfer the macaroni to a medium bowl. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of the

Colored Pasta Dough
From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)
Date: Wed, 4 Aug 93 0:51:03 CDT

These amounts should be enough to color about 1 1/2 pounds of pasta
dough, made with 3 to 4 cups of flour, 4 eggs and 2 tbsp olive oil.
You'll probably need to add a little bit of extra flour to compensate
for the extra moisture from the vegetables.
Green pasta. Parboil 1/2 pound of spinach for about two minutes or
chard for five minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water and squeeze the
leaves as dry as possible. Puree the spinach or chard through a sieve
or food mill, or chop it fine by hand or with a food processor. With
a fork, combine the spinach or chard with the pasta ingredients.
Knead, and roll out.
Speckled green pasta. Trim, wash, pat dry and chop fine about 6
tablespoons of mixed fresh herbs: parsley, sorrel, thyme, sage leaves,
tarragon, lovage, marjoram, basil, dandelion, rocket, hyssop and
tender savory shoots are all suitable. However, the strong herbs -thyme, sage, savory, marjoram and tarragon -- do not marry well with
some others, so choose your cherb mixture carefully. Stir the herbs
into the dough ingredients with a fork. Knead and roll out.
Red/pink pasta. Boil two small unpeeled beets in salted water for 40
minutes to one hour or until tender. Peel and chop the beets, then
puree them in a food processor. Stir the beet puree into the pasta
dough ingredients before kneading the dough and rolling it out.
Orange pasta. Stir about 1/4 cup of well-reduced tomato sauce or
pureed tomato into pasta dough ingredients. Knead and roll out.
Yellow pasta. Add a pinch of ground saffron to the flour and salt for
the pasta dough. Mix well. Stir in the eggs and oil. Knead and roll
out.

sliced okra (or green beans), cut in 1" pieces
sprigs parsley
minced fresh hot pepper (or .25 t hot pepper sauce)
dried basil or a few fresh leaves, chopped
salt (reduce if tomatoes are salted)
cooked noodles or whole wheat spirals or shells
cooked kidney or pinto beans, drained

Saute onion and bell pepper in oil in a 3-quart pot for 5 minutes
to soften. Add tomatoes, okra or green beans, parsley, and
seasonings. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes until vegetables are
just tender. Add pasta and beans and simmer uncovered for 10

NOTE: For 3 cups noodles, cooks 2.5 c (5 oz) pasta in boiling
saled water for 10 minutes or until barely tender. This can be
done either in advance or while the sauce simmers.
Menu Suggestions: Serve with a cheese appetizer or with Broccoli
Hollandaise; serve with a green sald. Use fresh fruit for
dessert.
--Personal experience: We used okra, canned tomatoes, canned red
beans, fresh basil, ordinary spirals, & hot pepper sauce, but
apparently not enough hot stuff, as it wasn't very spicy. We
actually made it in the microwave and it came out fine. Needs
more "sauce" though-maybe a can of tomato sauce or V-8. Good
reheated in the microwave for work lunches. A little Parmesan
cheese on top was good.

FETTUCINE ALFREDO
=================
Ingredients + Instructions:
--------------------------I recall reading somewhere that the original Fettucine Alfredo was just
a butter and parmesan coating. However, if you want the cream sauce I
think you're thinking of, why, here's one that should work.
Melt 1/2 stick of butter in a saucepan over low to medium heat. When it
begins to bubble, sprinkle in a tablespoon of flour and mix it in
quickly. Add 1/2 cup heavy cream, some pepper, and 1/4 cup grated
cheese like Parmesan or Pecorino. Stir constantly until thick. This
makes about 1 cup of sauce.

COLLECTION: Fettucine (mostly Alfredo)

1/2 cup
heavy cream
1 tblsp
finely chopped parsley
salt and garlic to taste
Bring a big pot of water to boil and add fettucine. Chop the parsley
very fine and grate the parmesan as fine as you can. (You will probably
need a fine hard cheese grater to do this.) Then melt the butter in a
small sauce pan (MELT IT DO NOT BOIL IT!) and remove from heat. Stir in
parmesan and then the cream *. Return to heat and just bring to boil at
a lowest setting stiring frequently.
Serve as soon as possible ... your fettucine should be done about now.
I like a sprig of parsley on the side as a garnish.
* If you are going to add salt and garlic do it at this point. I
suggest that you try the recipe without the first few times - its very
tasty without. Be vary carful when you do add salt and garlic its very
easy to overpower the sauce. I use just a tiny dash of both. But I
still love it without!
Note:
----If you use pre grated parmesan please don't use some cheap brand. The
only one I've found that worked was Kraft; the cheap ones use some
preserative or something that makes it seperate. I've given up and
always grate my own. The only other thing that I might say is that I
use a bit more that one cup of parmesan. (More like 1 1/2 cups) It
makes it a bit thicker and I love parmesan anyway.

The key to smooth, rich Alfredo sauce is to have all the ingredients at
the right temperature before you start. It's also important to use
freshly grated Parmesan cheese, not the powder that comes in the green
cans. Finally, have everything in place before you start, because you
will need to work quickly at the end.
I generally do this by eye, so the measurements are approximate.
In particular, I may not use all the cream if the sauce is looking
too thin.

FETTUCINE ALL'ALFREDO
=====================
Ingredients:
-----------1 pound Fettucine *1*
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/pasta/fettucine-coll.html (5 of 8) [12/17/1999 11:27:03 AM]

COLLECTION: Fettucine (mostly Alfredo)

1 cup
heavy cream
3 tblsp Butter *2*
Salt more than you think - to taste.
1 cup
Fresh Parmesan *3*
Fresh ground pepper
Dash
of nutmeg, freshly ground if possible.
Notes:
-----*1* Fresh if at all possible. Homemade is nice, but at this point one
can buy reasonable fresh pasta in most places. This recipe works
with dried pasta, but certainly benefits from fresh...
*2* Not margarine.

Alfredo is a splurge; do it right!

:-)

*3* Reggianno if you can find it and afford it. It really makes a
difference. If not, the Argentines make one of the best substitutes,
widely available, and it costs 40% less. If you can't find either,
buy Stella or even ungrated) frigo. In any event, whatever you buy,
buy it **ungrated** unless you are going to use it within a day or
two and trust the store to have grated it that day. Remember, the
better the ingredients, the better the dish. This is especially true
for this dish, due to its simplicity.
Instructions:
------------1) Put up a BIG pot of water to boil - 5 quarts+ works well (I usually
cook 1 lb. pasta in 7 quarts water in a 12 quart stockpot. In a rush,
I will go down to as little as 5 quarts, but not less if at all
possible. It makes pasta much more starchy and sticky, and increases
the chance that the pasta will stick to itself and/or the pot.)
2) Choose a large stove-to-table pan, wide and large enough to hold all
the pasta. (I use a 3.5 quart enamelled cast iron deep skillet, which
works wonderfully. Try to use a heavy duty, good pot.)
2a) If you are using dry pasta (the kind which takes between 8 and 12
minutes to cook, depending on the brand), wait until the water boils,
add 1-2 Tbsp coarse salt (regular also works, but for some reason coarse
salt is traditional in pasta water, or at least that was how I was
taught. If you are not worried about sodium, add 2 Tbsp. It makes the
pasta tastier.) Add the pasta.
3) Melt the butter over medium heat.
4) Add 2/3 cup of cream, and stir/cook for 1-2 minutes, until it
thickens somewhat. (This soemtimes takes a little longer, I'm not sure
exactly why. The exact timing doesn't matter too much.) Turn the stove

off.
5) If you are using fresh or homemade pasta, wait till the water boils,
add salt as in 2a above, and add the pasta. Remember that fresh pasta
takes remarkably little time to cook.
6) When the pasta is still **very** al dente (It will cook some more,
below), drain it and add it to the skillet with the butter and cream.
7) Turn the flame on, low. Stir the pasta to coat it. Add the rest of
the ingredients- cream, salt- start with 1/2 tsp, pepper, nutmeg, and
parmesan. Stir/toss for a few minutes until the sauce thickens. It may
need more salt, depending on the type of parmesan you are using and your
tastes.

Fresh Tomato Sauce with Mint and Garlic
on Spaghetti
From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 01:05:55 GMT

4 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 pounds tomatoes -- peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves, or more to taste
3/4 pound spaghetti
In a large skillet, place the garlic and 2 talespoons of the oil. Cook
over low heat until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Increase
the heat to high and cook until the garlic is golden, about 10 seconds
longer. Add the tomatoes and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally,
until the sauce is thick but chunky and some tomato liquid still remains,
about 10 minutes. Turn of the heat and season with the salt, pepper and
mint.
In a large saucepan of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti until
tender but still firm, about 8 minutes. Drain and toss with the remaining
1 tablespoon olive oil. Reheat the sauce over moderate heat. Place the
pasta in a large serving bowl and toss with a third of the sauce. Pour
the remaining sauce over the spaghetti; toss lightly and serve.

Fusilli Michelangelo
From: aliki@isi.com (Alexandra Schmidt)
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 93 15:50:08 PDT

Just for fun, here's a recipe for Fusilli Michelangelo:
For 2-3 people:
1 15-ounce can of stewed tomatoes
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 pound mushrooms
1/4 cup (packed) fresh basil leaves
1-2 cloves garlic
1-2 tbs. olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
Cut the mushrooms and dried tomatoes into julienne strips. Heat olive oil in
a saucepan and saute the vegetables briefly (about 3 minutes). Drain the can
of tomatoes and toss the tomatoes into a blender; blend until you have an
almost but not completely smooth puree. Add the basil leaves to the vegetablesand
saute, stirring constantly, for about 30 seconds (they should become
greener, but not cook too much). Add the puree. Press the garlic and stir in,and
grind in some black pepper. Cook for maybe 5 minutes (basil should not
be cooked too long or its color will fade). Salt to taste. Toss over about
10 oz. cooked fusilli.
This recipe is an original, though it's based on something I ate in an
Italian restaurant in Napa.

Assembling the Lasagna:
----------------------Take a LARGE casserole dish (11 x 14) and put 1 ladleful of tomato sauce
on the bottom of the dish to cover it. Place a layer of noodles on the
bottom, cutting or cracking them if necessary to fit. Another layer of
tomato sauce. Be generous. Another layer of noodles. Spread entire
cheese and spinach mixture evenly over the noodles. Another layer of
noodles. A generous layer of sauce. Pour bechamel sauce over the
sauce. Top with a layer of thick slices of mozzerella. Cover with foil
and refrigerate until 1 hour before. Bake covered at 350 degrees. It
doesn't hurt to place on a cookie sheet so if it overflows your oven
won't be too messy. After 45 minutes, remove the foil and bake for
another 15-25 minutes. Put a knife in the middle and feel the knife to
ensure the lasagne is hot in the middle. It should be bubbling. Remove
and let stand for 5 minutes at least. This will serve up in perfectly
uniform pieces, even with all that sauce! The noodles absorb the
liquid, that's why you need a runny sauce. Sprinkle individual pieces
with parmesan cheese (lots).
Modification:
------------Substitute chicken for beef and leave out the spinach. YUM!

spices to taste.
Bechamel Sauce:
--------------4 tblsp butter
6 tblsp flour
enough
water and milk
Spices: salt, pepper to taste
Attention: as neither my Mom nor I do measure when preparing Bechamel
Sauce, the above amounts are *rough* approximations! Just be sure you
have *enough* of the sauce when you do it the way you like it best.
'Enough' means about one litre of it, else the lasagna would come out
too dry.
Melt butter over low heat, then add flour, salt and pepper. You have to
stir it until well blended, then remove the pan from heat. Now stir in
milk and water (in small amounts) and return to heat. Cook while
stirring constantly, until the sauce is considerably thick and smooth.
To prepare the Lasagna:
----------------------We have four small souffle forms, so we prepare four small Lasagna
pieces. If you only have only one big souffle form you have to lay the
noodles, sauces and cheese in the one form. It doesn't matter if you
have three of four layers of the stuff, just be sure that you distribute
everything evenly. The below instruction is for four small forms.
First, oil souffle forms. The first layer should be a little bechamel
sauce on which the first lasagna noodle is placed. Cover this with
Sauce Bolognese, which should be topped with cheese slices and further
Bechamel Sauce. On this the next Lasagna noodle is placed.
Repeat procedure until you used up all noodles, sauces and cheese.
Be sure to have a layer of Bechamel sauce on the top!
When ready, put the forms into the oven and bake 25-30 minutes at 180
degrees Celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit).
Try not to gorge the stuff when you pull it out of the oven, you only
get blisters in the mouth. (I speak of experience - it's just too
delicious...)

TWO UNIQUE LASAGNE RECIPES (VEGAN)
==================================
The White Sauce:
---------------Make up a cheese sauce using
1/2 pt
2 level tblsp
3oz
lots

soya milk,
cornflour
strongly flavoured cheese
OR cream cheese, this gives a very interesting flavour
of grated nutmeg

For a vegan dish you can make your favorite white sauce.
The Lentil Filling:
------------------Boil 4 oz lentils in water until soft (as a rough guide, cover them and
add the same amount of water again).
Fry a chopped onion and some garlic in the oil of your choice. Add a
finely grated carrot and fry that too for a while. Add a can of chopped

tomatoes. Add some (tablespoon or so) of tomato paste. Add some
oregano or sweet mixed herbs. Add the lentils *and* the water they were
cooked in. Add a spoon of yeast extract. Season with salt and pepper.
The TVP Filling:
---------------While you are frying the rest of the stuff above put around 2/3 oz of
TVP mince in a bowl with plenty of boiling water and some concentrated
veg stock (vecon or stock cubes or yeast extract). When the other stuff
is ready add the TVP mix instead of the lentils and adjust the
seasonings.
Put it together
--------------Just like any other lasagne. If you use the no pre-cook pasta make sure
that the filling is sloppy so there's plenty of liquid to cook it.
Stick it in the oven at gas 4 (electric 350) (fan 160) for about half an
hour.
The lentil version is particularly nice and freezes well. However it is
very dry if you eat it the next day (or out of the freezer) and you will
need a wet sauce to go with it. I prefer it dry.

taste.

(I use non-fat egg product and low fat ricotta.)

Jazz up pasta sauce, if desired. (I usually throw in some extra
oregano, basil and onions, and let the whole thing cook for about a half
hour.)
In a 9X13 glass baking dish, put a couple of tablespoons of the sauce on
the bottom, spreading it evenly.
Put a layer of noodles in the pan. (You may have to trim one of the
noodles to fit along the bottom of the pan, like such:
-----------|
-----------|

|

Cover this layer with 1/2 the ricotta filling.
Cover the ricotta with roughly 1/4 the pasta sauce.
Then, some mozarella, about half of it.
Next, another layer of noodles, trimming as necessary.
Repeat ricotta, sauce and mozarella, using up the two cheeses.
Layer on the final few noodles.
Put some sauce on top, enough to cover liberally.
Cover this with the 1/4 c parmesan cheese.
Cover the dish with foil, and bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 hr,
uncovered for the last 10 minutes.
Let the lasagne cool for 15-20 minutes, to allow the cheese to set a
little before serving.
This lasagne is wonderful with a good, crusty garlic bread and a mixed
greens salad with oil and vinegar dressing.

Macaroni and Cheese (Casserole)

This is my family's favorite. My dad taught my mom how to make it right after
they got married, and he hasn't been back in the kitchen since (except to
sharpen knives!).
1 lb box of elbow macaroni -- cook according to package directions
margarine/butter
sharp cheddar cheese
salt
pepper
In a 2-quart casserole (I usually grease it, but I'm not sure that's
necessary), layer cooked macaroni, dabs of butter/cheese, and salt and pepper.
You should be able to do about 3-4 layers. After the top layer of
butter/cheese/salt/pepper, beat ONE EGG (or two if you like) in a 2-cup
measuring cup, then add MILK to make 2 cups. Beat together and pour over
macaroni. Pour more milk in to fill almost to top of macaroni. Crumble a
cracker (I usually use Ritz or Townhouse, but Saltine or anything else would
be fine) or sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top.
Bake at 375 for 45 minutes.

==============================
Ingredients:
-----------1/2 lb
sea scallops, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1
medium or 2 small fresh tomatoes, minced
into 1/4" pieces
4 slices bacon or pancetta, diced fine
3 cloves garlic, minced
Fresh thyme, salt and pepper to taste
1 pound
angel-hair pasta (also cappelini or
vermicelli)
Instructions:
------------Boil water for pasta. When it begins to boil, add
salt and oil, then
turn down and start the sauce.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon
or pancetta to
render out some of the drippings. Add garlic and
stir to brown. Add
scallops, cooking quickly to avoid browning but to
cook thoroughly (this
is why they're cut into thin slices).
When the scallops look nearly done, turn the water

then put the tomatoes into the skillet at the same

time you put the
pasta into the water. Cook for the requisite
amount of time (2-3
minutes fresh, 6-7 minutes dried), then drain and
*lightly* oil the
pasta with a good extra-virgin olive oil (this will
help keep the pasta
from clumping while you eat it). Toss the fresh
thyme into the skillet
and stir through before removing it from the heat.
Toss the pasta with the sauce and serve with
freshly grated parmigiano

Then she makes a dipping sauce out of soy sauce and
lemon juice.
Finally, she puts a bunch of ice cubes in the
bottom of a big serving
bowl, and dumps the noodles over them. She adds
enough water to immerse
the noodles, and puts everything on the table. The
dipping sauce goes
in little individual bowls, and each person gets a
large bowl to eat out
of. We usually help ourselves to noodles with our
bare hands, because
the ice water and the icy noodles feel so good on a
hot evening. All
the various good things are in separate dishes all
over the table,
making it very attractive to the eye, and each of
us fixes up a bowl of
noodles with his/her favorites in the desired
amounts. A multisensory

Penne Puttanesca
From: esca!tech60.dnet!vigil@uunet.UU.NET (I am not making this up)
Date: Thu, 15 Jul 1993 12:21:50 -0700

The following is from the new Seattle Times column, By Request, which
helps readers get recipes for favorite dishes they have enjoyed at
restaurants, and to locate recipes they have heard about or lost. As
a puttanesca connoisseur, I've found that Salvatore Ristorante Italiano
in Seattle makes the *best* puttanesca I've had at any restaurant in the
area. The following has been shared by the owner, Salvatore Anania.
Hope you enjoy it as much as I.

Marinara base:
4 medium cloves garlic,
peeled and coarsely chopped
20 large fresh basil leaves,
coarsely chopped
1/2 - 1 tsp salt

1/2 - 1 tsp freshly ground
black pepper
1/4 cup cold water
16 oz (2 cups) canned crushed
tomatoes

Puttanesca sauce:
1/2 cup olive oil
8 flat anchovy fillets, rinsed and
drained
3 medium cloves garlic, peeled
and minced
2 Tbsp finely chopped parsley

1 Tbsp crushed red pepper
1/4 cup capers, rinsed, drained
24 pitted Kalamata olives
16 oz penne pasta (or ziti or
mostaccioli)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1.

To prepare the marinara base: Combine the garlic and basil in a
food processor or blender and chop finely. Add the salt, black
pepper and water; process 30 seconds. Stir into the tomatoes and
set aside.

2.

To prepare the puttanesca sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large
saute pan. Add the anchovies and cook, mashing with the back of a
spoon, until disintegrated. Add the garlic, parsley and crushed
red pepper flakes. Cook 1 minute. Add the capers and olives;
cook 20 seconds.

3.

Stir in the marinara base an simmer 5 minutes.

4.

Cook the pasta in lots of boiling water according to package

Stir well and transfer to a heated

Note: The original recipe called for 2 Tbsp salt and 3 Tbsp crushed
red pepper flakes. Times testers felt that the reduced amounts were
adequate. [Moderator's Note: Maybe for the salt....]
Obmodification: I plan to reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup next time,
which is probably more than adequate and cuts down a bit on the fat.

Spaghetti Carbonara

Spaghetti Carbonara
From: mark.jacoby@medtronic.com (Mark Jacoby)
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 20:21:32 GMT

Well, here's our modified version:
1/3 # diced Sizzlean*(I know, trust me)
spaghetti
1/2 c grated _fresh_ parmesan
2 eggs
2 T butter
1 T olive oil
1 clove crushed garlic
fresh ground pepper
Start your water boiling for the pasta. Melt the butter in the olive
oil and add the garlic and Sizzlean. Cook but don't brown your garlic or
bacon-stuff. Grate the parmesan. Beat together the eggs, 1/4 cup
parmesan and pepper. When the pasta is done, drain and immediately
toss in the egg mixture. (The heat of the pasta cooks the eggs as
it coats the pasta.) Drain about 1/2 of the liquid from the
bacon-stuff/garlic and add the rest to the pasta with the rest
of the parmesan, toss again. Serve with more fresh ground pepper.
This is probably enough for 4 so measure your pasta accordingly.
*The sizzlean tastes more like ham than bacon, so if you want you
can use ham.
Quick and easy. Enjoy,

Spaghetti all' Puttanesca
From: David Gossett gossett@psych.colorado.edu
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 93 13:13:20 MDT

recipe by David Gossett
Ingredients
----------1 lb spaghetti (preferably Italian)
olive oil (traditionally quite a bit, but it works fine with less, maybe 2.5
tbsp or so)
2 or 3 cloves of garlic
1 dried red pepper
1 medium red onion
1 28 oz can tomatoes, preferably Italian plum tomatoes
tomato paste or "double concentrate", 2-4 tbsp
15 or so oil-cured olives
2 tbsp capers
Either:
2 or 3 sun-dried tomatoes (the kind packed in oil)
or
2 or 3 anchovies (Being a vegetarian, I don't ever do this anymore,
and I think that it is even better with the sun-dried tomatoes, anyway.)
Chop the garlic and red pepper. Set aside. Chop the red onion. Over a
medium flame, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and red pepper. In
a minute or so add the onion. Stir occaisionally. pit and chop the
olives, and chop the sundried tomatoes or anchovies. When the onion is
soft, (5 min?), add the tomatoes, tomato paste, olives, capers, and
sundried tomatoes/anchovies. With your stirring spoon, break up the canned
tomatoes a bit. Cook over medium to medium-high flame until most of the
moisture is gone and the sauce looks a little darker, 20-30 minutes. Serve
over spaghetti, with a small amount of parmesan.

Here is my favorite Puttanesca recipe, it is from Gourmet Magazine.
----------------------------------------We would like to offer a wonderful pasta recipe that we have not yet
seen in your pages. It can be prepared in a jiffy (indeed its name
is alleged to come from the fact that Italian prostitutes prepared it
between assignations). The anchovies are recommended by the chef of
a Neapolitan trattoria, and tradition has it that they are
indispensable.

teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes

drained canned Italian tomatoes, chopped fine, including 1/3
cup of the juice
flat anchovy fillets, drained and minced
Mediterranean-style brine-cured black olives, minced
teaspoons drained bottled capers
pound spaghetti
tablespoons freshly grated Romano or Parmesan

In a skillet cook the garlic and the red pepper flakes in the
oil over moderately low heat, stirring, for 20 seconds, stir in the
parsley, and cook the mixture for 10 seconds. Add the tomatoes with
the juice and cook the mixture over moderate heat for 1 minute. Add
the anchovies, the olives, and the capers and cook the sauce,
stirring, for 2 minutes. In a kettle of boiling salted water cook
the spaghetti until it is al dente, drain it, and in a bowl toss it
with the sauce. Sprinkle the pasta with the Romano. Serves 2 to 4.

Spaghetti Alla Puttanesca

GWS Notes: Start timing when ingredients begin to sizzle. I use a
cleaver to mince ingredients; I mince the anchovies and olives
together. I chop the capers if they are large (approx .75mm) and
leave them whole if they are small. If I use bottled cappers it is
VIMP to drain (I squeeze them) the capers, else they overpower
everything; if I use salt packed capers I soak them in a strainer
suspended in water to remove much of the salt. 1 tblspn of garlic
(minced) seems to do the trick "OK".

This recipe for Pasta alla Putanesca is from "Compliments of the
Chef, 100 Great Recipes from the Innovative Restaurants of Berkeley,
California," by Paul Johnston and the Sisterhood of Congregation Beth El,
Aris Books, Berkeley, CA, 1985, as served at Caffe Venezia. (whew!) :
"This robust pasta is a great way to start a meal, or it can
serve as a meal by itself. Freshly grated Reggiano is excellent
with this recipe. The heat of the dish can be adjusted to taste.

1/3 cup olive oil
9 anchovies
8 whole garlic cloves
1/4 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
4 medium ripe tomatoes, chopped and seeded
(enough to make 3 cups of tomatoes) or
one 28-ounce can tomatoes, chopped, w/juice
12 Calmata olives, pitted and halved
2 teaspoons capers, drained
5 garlic cloves, chopped
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1/2 to 3/4 pound fresh pasta
Chopped fresh parsley
Heat the oil in a saute' pan or skillet. Add the anchovies
and whole garlic cloves. Cook until the garlic cloves brown
and the anchovies fall apart. Add the red pepper flakes and
cook a few seconds more. Add the tomatoes, olives, and capers.
Simmer for 30 minutes. Add the chopped garlic, parsley, and
basil to the sauce and simmer a bit longer.
Cook the fresh pasta in plenty of boiling salted water for 2
to 3 minutes or until 'al dente.' Toss with half of the sauce
until well coated. Arrange the pasta on a platter and pour the
remaining sauce on top. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over all.
Serves 4."
I prefer dry pasta and use much more capers and anchovies.

Vegetarian Lasagne
From: Radha Venkat radha@minos.Princeton.EDU
Date: Mon, 9 Aug 93 08:48:25 EDT

Taken (with modifications by me) from the Moosewood Cookbook:
Vegetarian Lasagne:
1 large jar good pasta sauce
1 lb either mushrooms, sliced, or spinach, cleaned and chopped
12 lasagne noodles, half-cooked
2 c Ricotta cheese
1 c mozarella
2 tsp wheat germ
2 eggs
salt,pepper
1/4 c parmesan cheese, grated fine
Mix the ricotta, mushrooms/spinach, wheat germ and eggs in a large
bowl. (Do not crush the mushroom slices!) Add 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper
to taste. (I use non-fat egg product and low fat ricotta.)
Jazz up pasta sauce, if desired. (I usually throw in some extra oregano,
basil and onions, and let the whole thing cook for about a half hour.)
In a 9X13 glass baking dish, put a couple of tablespoons of the sauce on
the bottom, spreading it evenly.
Put a layer of noodles in the pan. (You may have to trim one of the noodles
to fit along the bottom of the pan, like such:
-----------|
-----------|
-----------|
-----------|

|
|
|
|

Cover this layer with 1/2 the ricotta filling.
Cover the ricotta with roughly 1/4 the pasta sauce.
Then, some mozarella, about half of it.
Next, another layer of noodles, trimming as necessary.
Repeat ricotta, sauce and mozarella, using up the two cheeses.
Layer on the final few noodles.
Put some sauce on top, enough to cover liberally.
Cover this with the 1/4 c parmesan cheese.

Vegetarian Lasagne

Cover the dish with foil, and bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 hr,
uncovered for the last 10 minutes.
Let the lasagne cool for 15-20 minutes, to allow the cheese to set a little
before serving.
This lasagne is wonderful with a good, crusty garlic bread and a mixed
greens salad w/ oil and vinegar dressing.
Enjoy!

An easy and good recipe, for hard core blue cheese fans, crumble some
cheese into a bowl and just cover it with milk. Cover the bowl and let
it sit on a counter all day. It will thicken as it sits. If it is not
chunky enough for you, just add some more cheese. This recipe was given
to me by a doctor, for a friend with ulcers.

Blue Cheese Dressing (3)
From: adamr@tamu.edu (Adam B. Roach)
Subject: Blue Cheese Dressing

1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup salad oil
3 Tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup (2 oz.) crumbled blue cheese
1/2 teaspoon minced onion
Place milk, oil, salt, and onion in blender.
Add vinegar while mixing. (This is important
for consistancy. If you add less vinegar, it
will not be thick enough.) Add blue cheese and
mix briefly to ditribute it evenly. (I like
large chunks, so I sometimes do this part by
hand.) Refrigerate until thickened.

This stuff is great, but don't worry too much about exact amounts...
You'll probably have to fiddle around a bit to get the amounts right.
Recipe courtesy of my future Lebanese grandmother-in-law.
1/4 bunch fresh parsley
1 clove garlic, mashed with 1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 lemons, squeezed for their juice (get rid of rest of lemon)
2 tblsp oil
1/4 cup dried mint (from your own garden is best!)

Salad Dressing

Salad Dressing
From: melcue@is.rice.edu (Melissa Elaine Cue)
Date: Wed, 28 Jul 1993 15:30:21 GMT

Here's a recipe that I like to use--I don't buy salad dressing
any more because this is so easy.

3 tablespoons salad oil
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon crushed parsley (I usually use dried)
1/2 teaspoon salt
dash pepper
few shakes of your favorite hot sauce (Tabasco, Louisiana, etc.)
The hot sauce doesn't make it spicy, just adds a bit of
flavor.
To speed up the dissolving of the sugar and salt, I put the
vinegar, sugar, and salt in a jar and zap in the microwave for
about 30 seconds, which helps the stuff to dissolve.
The finished product keeps for awhile in the frig.
Good luck!

Caesar Salad

Date: Thu, 22 Jul 1993 19:11:23 +0000 (GMT)

Here is my recipe for Caesar Salad.

Hope you enjoy it.

Caesar Salad
1 head Romaine lettuce
4 cloves garlic, minced (or diced or mashed or whatever)
3 tbsp vegie oil (I use Canola)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp lemon juice
1 egg
2 or 3 shakes of Tobasco sauce
2 or 3 shakes of Watsdishere sauce (worchestershire)
2 or 3 grains of salt (or more if you're so inclined)
1/4 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
Mix all ingredients except lettuce in a shaker and shake
until well mixed.
Break lettuce into bite sized pieces and put it into a bowl.
I find that a wooden bowl works well. Pour the sauce over
the lettuce and toss to coat. Enjoy.

Caesar Salad Recipe

Caesar Salad Recipe
From: billen_j@atdiv.lanl.gov (James H. Billen)
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 08:42:21 -0600

Ingredients for 4 large servings:
2 large or 3 medium cloves of garlic
1 entire 2-ounce tin of flat anchovy fillets
2 coddled eggs
1 cup croutons (see below)
1/2 cup olive oil
1 large or 2 medium bunches of romaine lettuce
1 small lemon cut into quarters
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
These quantities are approximate. Experiment to suit your own
taste. For example, fewer anchovy fillets will make the dressing
less tart. You can vary the relative proportion of olive oil as
much as a factor of two to adjust the total bulk of dressing for
different amounts of lettuce with little effect on the flavor.
Procedure:
1.

Wash and dry the lettuce. Tear into bite-sized pieces and
chill until ready to toss.

2.

Press the garlic cloves into the bowl. With a large wooden
spoon squeeze the pieces against the side of the bowl mashing
them into small bits.

3.

Cut up the anchovy fillets and then add to the bowl. Mash
them with the spoon to make a paste. Add the Worcestershire
sauce, pepper, and mustard and mix into the paste.

4.

Break the shell of the coddled eggs over the bowl by striking
with a butter knife. Pour into the bowl whatever flows out of
the shell halves. Discard the shells and the small portion of
egg white that still clings to the shell. Thoroughly mix the

Caesar Salad Recipe

ingredients by swirling the bottom of the wooden spoon around
the inside of the bowl.
5.

Squeeze the juice of a lemon quarter into the bowl, add the
olive oil, and mix again as above.

6.

Immediately before you are ready to eat the salad, toss the
lettuce in the bowl until the leaves are well coated with
dressing.

7.

Squeeze the remaining lemon and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese
over the leaves. Add croutons and toss again until all the
croutons have begun to absorb some of the dressing.

8.

Serve immediately on large dinner plates, usually before
serving the entree.

Caesar salad notes:
Philosophy: The most important feature of a Caesar salad is the
delicate taste of the dressing that you prepare in the bowl. It
does not keep well and thus the salad should be eaten immediately
after it is made. The lettuce and croutons serve as the vehicle
for the dressing's flavor. Adding additional ingredients such as
tomatoes, onions, or mushrooms, which have distinctive flavors of
their own, masks the taste of the dressing and is considered
highly irregular.
Salad bowl: The best bowl is solid teak with a hemispherical
shape about 12 inches in diameter. To care for the bowl coat it
lightly with olive oil. Clean the bowl as soon as possible after
serving the salad. The maker of my bowl advised not to use water
in it. However, I have found that a quick rinse with warm water
followed by thorough towel drying and light oiling keeps the bowl
in good shape. (My bowl is over 22 years old.)
Coddled eggs: To prevent egg shells from cracking when first
immersed in boiling water, let the eggs sit out at room
temperature for half an hour. Or, warm the shells by running
cool, then gradually warmer tap water over them. Bring to a boil
enough water to cover the eggs. Place the eggs in the boiling
water for 1 minute and then immediately remove to cool water for
a few minutes. At high elevations leave them in longer (total of
about 2 minutes at 7500 feet).

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mjw/recipes/salad/caesar-salad-2.html (2 of 3) [12/17/1999 11:36:32 AM]

Caesar Salad Recipe

Croutons: For very fresh, absorbent croutons make your own from
ordinary white sliced bread. I use one slice per person. First,
put the bread slices in the freezer (wrapped in plastic) until
the slices are firm. With a sharp knife, cut off the crusts and
feed the pieces to the birds. Cut the rest of the bread into
roughly 1/2-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a single layer on a
cookie sheet and bake at about 250 degrees to dry them out. Stir
the cubes around once or twice. Remove them from the oven when
they are a very light tan color (usually 30 to 45 minutes).
Croutons will stay fresh for several days in a closed
refrigerated container.
Substitutions: The most spectacular salad contains all fresh
ingredients. However, if you need to simplify the procedure, here
are some recommendations for substitutions. Use a few tablespoons
of lemon juice in place of a freshly squeezed lemon. In place of
the garlic cloves you could sprinkle garlic powder (but not
garlic salt!) into the bowl. You can try commercially prepared
grated Parmesan cheese, but freshly grated Parmesan is sweeter
and has a better texture. (Commercial grated cheese often
contains cellulose to prevent caking. If it does, it will taste
just like a cardboard box.) Ordinary head lettuce instead of
romaine might do in an emergency, but it's not for guests.
Anchovy paste in place of flat fillets is not a very good
substitute. Never use anything but pure olive oil.
Technique: Part of the enjoyment of a Caesar salad is watching
the chef create it at the table. Prepare all of the ingredients
ahead of time and arrange them in saucers and bowls on a small
table next to the dining table. Be sure to include a stack of
dinner plates and a small bowl for discarding the egg shells. Do
everything with a flourish and occasionally tip the bowl allowing
your guests to watch (and sniff) your progress.

from Melissa Probst melissa@spanky.jpl.nasa.gov:
Sounds yummy!
Cobb salad is a wonderful main dish salad. Here is the recipe from the
Brown Derby in Los Angeles where it was created:

Cobb Salad
6 cups shredded lettuce
3 cups chopped cooked chicken
3 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
2 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese (3 ounces)
6 slices bacon, crisp-cooked, drained and crumbled
1 medium avocado, halved, seeded, peeled and cut into wedges
1 small stalk Belgian endive (optional)
Brown Derby French Dressing
Place lettuce on 6 individual plates. Evenly divide chicken, eggs, tomatoes,
blue cheese and bacon among plates, arranging each in a row on top of the
lettuce. Place avocado wedges and endive leaves, if desired, to the side.
Serve with Brown Derby French Dressing. Makes 6 servings.

Brown Derby French Dressing
In a screw-top jar, combine 1/3 cup red-wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice,
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon sugar,
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1 clove garlic, minced.
Cover and shake to mix well. Add 1/2 cup olive oil, or salad oil; cover and
shake vigorously. Chill thoroughly. Shake before serving. Makes 1 cup.

1 package fresh cranberries (12 oz)
2-3 stalks celery
2-3 apples, peeled, cored,
sugar to taste
whipping cream
Grind together the cranberries, celery, and apples. I use an old fashioned
food grinder (a food processor works, but you have to be very careful not
to over process). Color should be a fairly rich red. Add sugar to taste
(the amount will depend on how tart the apples are). Spread into a bowl and
chill. Shortly before serving, spread a layer of whipped cream over the top.
This is a required dish for my husband's family. I have rarely made it
without someone asking for the recipe and they can't believe that it is
so simple (and do-ahead-able).

Cuban Tofu Salad
From: Marilyn Walker mwalker@taimyr.colorado.edu
Date: Thu, 15 Jul 1993 21:41:14 GMT

This was inspired by a friend's Cuban Chicken Salad, but it is quite
different from her recipe. I couldn't think of what else to call it.
All measurements are approximate as I made this up from scratch and
didn't record anything. This salad is a complete summer meal that got
rave reviews.
1 pound firm tofu
1/3 c. nutritional yeast with salt, pepper, and paprika added to taste
oil
1 pound new potatoes
1 good-sized sweet potato or yam (6-8 inches long)
1 mild tasting apple (Golden Delicious is good), sliced or chopped
4 eggs, hard cooked, sliced
1/2 c. green peas, cooked until still slightly firm
1/2 red onion, finely chopped
1 can asparagus tips
mayonnaise (about 3/4 c.)
about 2 T. dill weed
vinegar, mustard, or "Durkee's special sauce"
1. Cut tofu into 1" squares, 1/2" thick. Coat with nutritional yeast.
Fry in oil over medium heat until golden brown and slightly chewy. Drain
on paper towels.
2. Cut potatoes and sweet potatoes into 1" cubes.

thin asparagus spears
2 heads leaf lettuce, washed and drained

cherry tomatoes, halved
1/4 tsp Dijon mustard

shallow glass aking dish in a single layer. Whisk together 1/4 cup plus
2 tblsp raspberry vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, garlic, parsley, and
onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour over breasts and

3

3

lemon juice
Garnish:
-------mustard
radish

Instructions:
------------In a large glass bowl, peel and slice paper thin (#1) 6 medium cucumbers
and 1/3 large daikon radish.
Mix in 1/2 cup coarse salt or more, if necessary, to coat all slices.
Let stand 10-15 minutes to draw out the water. Drain very well, and
squeeze out as much water as you can (#2).
Add 3 small white onions, sliced paper thin; 3 scallions (including
green parts), sliced thin; 3 sprigs fresh dill, chopped and 6 sprigs
watercress, chopped. Add white vinegar almost to cover. Supplement
with enough lemon juice to cover. Add 3 tblsp sugar, or to taste (#3).
Mix well, and store in a glass jar refrigerated. Keep at least one day
before serving. Garnish with mustard, radish, or cress sprouts.
Notes:
-----(#1) Paper thin means as thin as paper.

(#2) This is very important. If you don't do this properly, it will be
too watery. What I do is squeeze out as much as I can, and then I give
it one more good squeeze.
(#3) But if you're going to add cups of sugar, you might as well buy
generic cucumber salad at your local deli. This is called a *sour*
salad, after all.
This makes a lot. You can scale the recipe, but while you're going to
the trouble, you might as well make a lot; it keeps well in the
refrigerator.

JOSHUA'S CORN SALAD
===================
Ingredients:
-----------Required:
--------1
16oz can whole kernal corn
1/2
3oz bottle bacon bits
1/2
4oz can chopped black olives
Optional (use one or more):
--------------------------Sprinkle of sun dried tomatoes
1
4oz can of diced mild chiles
Chopped tomatoes
Instructions:
------------Drain as much liquid as possible from each ingredient, and combine in a
large serving bowl.
There are two notes on the ingredients: first, use real bacon bits (I
use Hormel), those hard crunchy things found at salad bars don't combine
well with the softer ingredients. Second, I think that the corn
matters, and I use the best I can find (which is usually Trader Joe's).
The olives, mild chiles, and dried tomatoes seem to matter much less.

Reserve oil to cook peanuts.
2. One at a time, blanch vegetables in lightly salted water, rinsing
them in cold water to stop cooking as soon as they reach the desired
degree of doneness. Cabbage and bean sprouts require only a few
seconds; carrots, green beans, and potatoes may take several minutes
depending on size and tenderness. Do not blanch cucumbers, watercress,
and tomatoes. use them raw.
3. Place Gado-Gado Sauce in a small bowl in the center of a large
platter. Arrange vegetables on platter around sauce. Garnish with
wedges or slices of hard-cooked egg and fried onion flakes. To serve,
spoon some sauce onto each plate and dip vegetables into sauce.
Serves 4 to 6 with other dishes.
To prepare Gado-Gado Sauce:
--------------------------1. To prepare sauce in a mortar: Pound garlic, shallot, galangal,
shrimp paste, and chile to a paste. To prepare sauce in a blender: Chop
together in a 1-cup jar.
2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until a
peanut sizzles on contact. Fry peanuts until lightly browned; transfer
to paper towels to drain. When peanuts have cooled, grind in a mortar
or food processor to a coarse, grainy paste, adding a little oil if
necessary to facilitate blending. (May be made up to a week ahead and
stored covered in refrigerator.)
3. Remove all but 2 tablespoons oil from pan and reserve for another
use. Return pan to medium-low heat and add pounded mixture. Cook until
quite fragrant, but do not burn. Add peanuts, sugar, and coconut milk
and bring to a boil, stirring. Simmer until thick and season to taste
with salt and lime juice. Allow to coot to room temperature before
serving.

Ingredients:

you like)

it with a lid and shake. If you don't plan on eating the salad right
away, you can put the dressing in the fridge for a while...it tastes
better when it's been chilled for an hour or so.
When you're ready to serve, put the cucumbers in dishes or small bowls,
and pour the dressing over them. Fake crabmeat tastes good in this
dressing, too.

Get a nice roast, around a pound or so. Roast until medium-rare. Let
cool and slice into a thick julienne. Add to it about 1/3 to 1/2 cup
walnut pieces and 1/4 to 1/3 cup crumbled bleu cheese.
Dress with a nice vinaigrette made with olive oil and balsamic vinager

you like bleu cheese. Use a tender roast, like a sirloin for this.

Add more oil if you think it

Combine all ingredients in bowl, toss and serve with red wine. If liver
and bread settle at the bottom of bowl, you may have used a lettuce with
too stiff leaves or have sliced them too big.
Note:
----I don't usually post here, but for chicken livers I will make an
exception. It is really very silly to throw them away, as they contain
most of the Vit.B complex, 50% of the iron, and in particular most of
the Vit.B-12 in the animal (and these are the nutrients we dominantly
intake from meat). Ie, nutritionally speaking, the liver is worth more
than the whole chicken.
This is a delicious, quick salad where the liver characteristic flavor
(a minus for many) becomes actually a plus when combined with the rest.

TUNA SALAD
==========
Ingredients:
-----------albacore tuna, chopped very fine and drained
mayo
lots of sweet pickle relish (optional)
lots of finely minced red/purple onion,
A decent amount of garlic powder (to taste)
cayenne pepper (to taste)
A touch of cumin
eggs (optional)
Instructions:
------------Use white albacore tuna, chopped very fine and drained extremely well
(squeeze it if you have to). If you don't drain it nearly dry, it will
hide its moisture until you refrigerate it (either before you serve it
or the leftovers after) and then become a watery mess.
Add mayo (Best [or Hellman's, as it is marketed on that other coast] is
my choice) and [optionally] lots of sweet pickle relish. I like the
sweetness to offset the saltiness of the tuna.
Mix this to the desired texture/moisture level, a bit on what you think
is the dry side. Then add:
Lots of finely minced red/purple onion,
A decent amount of garlic powder (to taste, don't hide the tuna taste)
Enough cayenne to give it an appropriate light afterburn, no more
A touch of cumin
Mix it extremely well. You will now find that the garlic powder and
cayenne have soaked up a tiny bit of moisture, and it may seem too dry.
IT ISN'T! If you are setting this out at a party, be sure to wander by
every now and then and mix it up well -- that'll keep the moisture from
settling to the bottom.

Cross Indexed Salad, German
Very simple:
Slice the tomatoes, add some sliced onions and put it in an oil/vinegar sauce.
Add some salt and pepper.
Refinements: use olive oil instead of 'normal'; add garlic and / or parsley.

From Great Dinners From Life

1 pound veal stew meat
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon water
2 medium potatoes
3 eggs
3 5 ounce jars of Bismarck herring
2 tablespoons capers, drained
1 1/2 cups chopped red onion
1 1/2 cups chopped dill pickle
1/2 cup chopped parsley
1 2 ounce can flat anchovy fillets, drained
1 8 ounce can whole beets, drained
Romaine lettuce
1 lemon, in small wedges
Sour cream dressing
Lightly brown the veal chunks in the butter, then add one tablespoon water,
cover the pan and braise the veal for one hour. Let it cool, then trim the
pieces and cut them into cubes. Meanwhile peel and dice potatoes; cook them
in boiling salted water for 15 minutes or until tender. Drain and cool.
Put the eggs in a saucepan, cover them with cold water, bring to a boil,
cover pan and turn off heat. Let the eggs stand for 20 minuts. Cool them
at once by putting them into cold water for a few minutes. Peel them and
rice the whites and yolks separately by putting them through a sieve.
Drain and trim the herring. Cut the fillets into one-half-inch squares.
Mix the capers with the herring pieces. Finely chop the onion, pickle and
parsley, julienne the beets.
Refrigerate all ingredients covered, until you are ready to arrange the
salad. Then set out the ingredients as attractively as you can. If you are
using a round bowl, arrange them in wedges (like a pie). If you are using a
platter arrange them in strips. Garnish with leaves of romaine and with the
lemon wedges.
At the table mix with ingredients together with about half the amount of the
sour cream dressing. Pass the rest of the dressing in a small bowl.

Singapore Noodle Salad
From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 06:14:45 GMT

1/4 cup sesame seeds
1/2 pound dried Chinese spaghetti-style noodles
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 bunch broccoli, separated into 1 inch florets
1 pound asparagus, cut on the diagonal into 1 inch pieces
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon dry sherry
2 teaspoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese chili sauce
1/4 cup minced scallions
2 tablespoons finely minced fresh ginger
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 cup bean sprouts
1 cup thinly sliced button or shiitake mushrooms, or separated enoki
1 large red bell pepper, cut into thin julienne
2 tablespoons minced chives
In a small dry skillet, toast the sesame seeds over moderately high heat,
tossing, until fragrant and golden brown, about 1 minute. Set aside.
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the noodles, separating them
with a fork, until tender but still firm, about 2 1/2 minutes. Drain and
rinse under cold running water, drain well and toss with the vegetable oil.
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the
broccoli and cook until crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted
spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water and chill until cold, about 5
minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the asparagus, cooking them
for only 1 to 2 minutes.
In a small saucepan, bring the stock to a boil over moderately high heat;
remove from the heat. Stir in the peanut butter, vinegar, soy sauce,
sesame oil, sherry, sugar, chili sauce, scallions, ginger, garlic and
toasted sesame seeds.
In a large bowl, toss together the noodles, broccoli, asparagus, bean

Tomato, Basil, Parsley, & Mint Salad

Tomato, Basil, Parsley, & Mint Salad
From: johnt@wv.mentorg.com (John Thienes)
Date: Mon, 13 Sep 93 13:50:10 -0700

I created the following recipe, mostly out of desparation, to use
the bounty o'erflowing from my garden. In spite of unseasonable
summer weather in the Pacific Northwest, cool and wet this year,
there is last ditch growth and ripening in the presence of recent
warm sunny days from everything in an apparent effort to regain
lost time.
Even though the combination of the fresh herbs may seem a bit odd,
especially the inclusion of mint, let me commend this salad to you
as a delightful, refreshing dish to accompany your [late] summer
dinners.

2
pints cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup
chopped fresh basil
1
cup
chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup
chopped fresh mint
1
clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup
homemade mayonnaise
salt and pepper to taste
Romaine lettuce
French bread
Quarter the tomatoes into a medium mixing bowl.
In a small bowl combine the basil, parsley, mint, and
garlic making sure all of the herbs are well mixed. Stir
the mayonnaise into the herbs, making a "green" dressing.
Add salt and fresh ground pepper to your taste. Carefully
mix the dressing into the tomato quarters until they're
all covered. Cover the bowl and let it "rest" until just
before serving.
Make individual servings of Romaine lettuce torn into bite
sized pieces. Serve the tomatoes over the lettuce. Pass
the pepper grinder around for those who want more pepper,
and soak up the salad "juices" with fresh French bread.

Serves 4-6.
Note: The homemade mayonnaise was made from Anna Thomas's
second volume of _The Vegetarian Epicure_, however, I'm sure
that most any other favorite homemade mayo will do.
